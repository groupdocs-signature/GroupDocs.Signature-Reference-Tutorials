## Core Event Handling Implementation

### Understanding GroupDocs Signature Events

GroupDocs.Signature provides three key event types that you can subscribe to:

- **ProcessStartEventArgs**: Fired when the signing process begins
- **ProcessProgressEventArgs**: Triggered during signing progress updates  
- **ProcessCompleteEventArgs**: Called when the signing operation finishes

Each event provides valuable context about the current operation, making it easy to build responsive applications.

### Setting Up Your Event Handlers

Here's how to implement comprehensive event handling for document signing operations:

**Step 1: Create Your Event Handler Class**

```csharp
public class SignEventSubscription
{
    private static void OnSignStarted(Signature sender, ProcessStartEventArgs args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sign process started at {0} with {1} total signatures to be put in document", 
            DateTime.Now, args.TotalSignatures);
    }

    private static void OnSignProgress(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sign progress. Processed {0} signatures out of {1}. Progress: {2}%", 
            args.ProcessedSignatures, args.TotalSignatures, args.Progress);
    }

    private static void OnSignCompleted(Signature sender, ProcessCompleteEventArgs args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sign process completed at {0} with {1} total signatures. Process took {2} milliseconds", 
            DateTime.Now, args.TotalSignatures, args.Ticks);
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Subscribe to Events and Execute Signing**

```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    // Initialize the signature object with your document
    using (Signature signature = new Signature("sample.pdf"))
    {
        // Subscribe to all signing events
        signature.SignStarted += OnSignStarted;
        signature.SignProgress += OnSignProgress;
        signature.SignCompleted += OnSignCompleted;

        // Configure your text signature options
        TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
        {
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100,
            Width = 100,
            Height = 30
        };

        // Execute the signing process with event monitoring
        SignResult result = signature.Sign("output.pdf", options);
        
        // Process the results
        Console.WriteLine($"Document signed successfully. Size: {result.FileInfo.Size}");
    }
}
```

## Advanced Event Handling Patterns

### Handling Multiple Signature Types

When working with complex documents that require multiple signature types (text, image, QR codes), your event handlers become even more valuable:

**Why this matters**: Different signature types have varying processing times and complexity. Event handling helps you provide accurate progress updates and identify bottlenecks in your signing workflow.

```csharp
private static void OnSignProgress(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args)
{
    // Calculate percentage for progress bars
    double completionPercentage = ((double)args.ProcessedSignatures / args.TotalSignatures) * 100;
    
    // Update your UI or log detailed progress
    Console.WriteLine($"Processing signature {args.ProcessedSignatures} of {args.TotalSignatures}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Completion: {completionPercentage:F1}%");
    
    // Useful for updating progress bars in desktop/web applications
    UpdateProgressBar(completionPercentage);
}
```

### Error Handling and Resilience

While the provided code focuses on successful operations, robust applications need comprehensive error handling:

**Common scenarios to handle**:
- Document access permissions issues
- Invalid signature configurations
- Network timeouts (for cloud-based operations)
- Memory constraints with large files

**Best practice**: Always wrap your signing operations in try-catch blocks and log both successful events and exceptions for debugging purposes.

## Performance Optimization Tips

### When Event Handling Impacts Performance

Event handling adds minimal overhead, but here are optimization strategies for high-volume applications:

**Batch Processing**: If you're processing multiple documents, consider subscribing to events once and reusing the same handlers across operations.

**Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await patterns when your event handlers perform I/O operations (like logging to databases or sending web requests).

**Memory Management**: Unsubscribe from events when your Signature object goes out of scope to prevent memory leaks in long-running applications.

```csharp
// Good practice: Clean up event subscriptions
signature.SignStarted -= OnSignStarted;
signature.SignProgress -= OnSignProgress;  
signature.SignCompleted -= OnSignCompleted;
```

## Common Use Cases and Practical Applications

### Building Progress Indicators

Event handling shines when creating responsive user interfaces. The progress events provide exact percentages, making it easy to update progress bars or provide status updates to users.

**Perfect for**: Desktop applications, web applications with real-time updates, or API endpoints that need to report progress to calling applications.

### Audit Trail Generation  

Enterprise applications often require detailed logging for compliance purposes. Event handlers make it trivial to capture:
- Exact timestamps for signing operations
- Processing duration for performance monitoring
- Success/failure rates for quality metrics

### Integration with External Systems

Use event handlers as integration points with:
- Notification systems (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Database logging systems
- Workflow orchestration platforms
- Business intelligence tools

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Events Not Firing

**Problem**: Your event handlers aren't being called during signing operations.

**Common causes and solutions**:
- **Subscription timing**: Make sure you subscribe to events before calling the Sign method
- **Object disposal**: Verify your Signature object hasn't been disposed before the operation completes
- **Exception handling**: Check if exceptions in your event handlers are preventing subsequent events from firing

### Performance Issues with Event Handlers

**Problem**: Signing operations become slow after adding event handling.

**Investigation steps**:
- Profile your event handler code for bottlenecks
- Avoid heavy I/O operations in event handlers (consider async patterns)
- Check if you're accidentally subscribing to the same events multiple times

### Inaccurate Progress Reporting

**Problem**: Progress percentages don't align with actual signing progress.

**Understanding the behavior**: Progress events are based on signature count, not file size or processing complexity. A single complex signature might represent 50% of the work but only 10% of the signature count.

## Best Practices for Production Applications

### Robust Event Handler Design

**Keep handlers lightweight**: Event handlers should execute quickly to avoid blocking the signing process. Move heavy operations to background tasks.

**Implement proper logging**: Use structured logging (like Serilog) to capture event data in a queryable format.

**Handle exceptions gracefully**: Never let exceptions in event handlers crash your signing operations.

### Testing Event-Driven Code

**Unit testing strategy**: Mock the Signature class and verify that your event handlers are called with expected parameters.

**Integration testing**: Test with various document types and sizes to ensure consistent event behavior.

**Performance testing**: Measure the overhead of event handling in your specific use case.

## Conclusion

Mastering GroupDocs Signature .NET event handling transforms your document signing applications from black boxes into transparent, responsive systems. You now have the tools to build enterprise-grade solutions that provide real-time feedback, robust error handling, and comprehensive audit trails.
