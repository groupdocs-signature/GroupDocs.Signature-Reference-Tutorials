## Implementation Guide

This section walks you through retrieving supported file formats using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

### Retrieving Supported File Formats

**Overview:**
This feature allows your application to dynamically list all file types that the GroupDocs.Signature library supports, making it easier to manage and process various documents seamlessly.

```

**Explanation:**
- `FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes()` retrieves all supported file types.
- `.OrderBy(f => f.Extension)` sorts the list alphabetically by file extension.

#### Step 2: Display File Format Information

Iterate over each file type and output its details:

```csharp
foreach (FileType fileType in supportedFileTypes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fileType);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This loop traverses each `FileType` object, displaying essential information such as extension and MIME type.
