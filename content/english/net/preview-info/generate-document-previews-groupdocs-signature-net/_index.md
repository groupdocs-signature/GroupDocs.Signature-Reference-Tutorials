### Installation Methods
#### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

#### Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

#### NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" in your IDE's NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use GroupDocs.Signature, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain it from their website for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Acquire a commercial license for production use.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Initialize the Signature object with your file path
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_ZIP";
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code implementation here...
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Generate Document Previews in Archives
#### Overview
This feature enables you to create visual previews of documents within various archive formats. Follow the steps below for implementation.

#### Step 1: Instantiate a Signature Object
Create an instance of the `Signature` class with your archive file path.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_ZIP";

// Create an instance of Signature\using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Proceed with preview generation...
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure PreviewOptions
Set up `PreviewOptions` to handle the creation and release of streams.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

PreviewOptions previewOption = new PreviewOptions(CreatePageStream, ReleasePageStream)
{
    PreviewFormat = PreviewOptions.PreviewFormats.PNG
};
```
- **CreatePageStream**: Generates a stream for each document page.
- **ReleasePageStream**: Cleans up resources used by the generated streams.

#### Step 3: Generate Previews
Invoke preview generation with your configured options.
```csharp
signature.GeneratePreview(previewOption);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
