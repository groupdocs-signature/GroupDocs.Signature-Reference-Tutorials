## Best Practices for Implementation

**Performance Considerations**: When implementing preview generation, consider caching strategies to avoid regenerating previews for the same documents. Most applications benefit from storing previews in a fast-access location like cloud storage or a CDN.

**Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling for document processing operations. Corrupted files, unsupported formats, and network issues can all affect preview generation, so plan for graceful degradation.

**Security**: When extracting document information, be mindful of sensitive data. Consider implementing access controls and audit logging for document inspection activities, especially in enterprise environments.
