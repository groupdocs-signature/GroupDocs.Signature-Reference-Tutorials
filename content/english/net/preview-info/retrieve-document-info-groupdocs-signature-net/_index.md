{
    // All your document operations happen here
}
```

The `using` statement ensures proper resource cleanup—something you'll definitely want in production applications.

## How to Extract Document Information - Step by Step

### Understanding the Document Info Extraction Process

When you need to analyze a signed document, GroupDocs.Signature provides a comprehensive `GetDocumentInfo()` method that returns everything you need to know. This isn't just about file size—you get detailed insights into signatures, page dimensions, and document structure.

Here's the complete implementation with detailed explanations:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SampleSignedMulti";

// Initialize the Signature object with the document path
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Retrieve the document information using GetDocumentInfo method
    IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
    
    // Output basic properties of the document
    Console.WriteLine($"- format : {documentInfo.FileType.FileFormat}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- extension : {documentInfo.FileType.Extension}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- size : {documentInfo.Size}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- page count : {documentInfo.PageCount}");

    // Output counts of various signature types
    Console.WriteLine($"- Form Fields count : {documentInfo.FormFields.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Text signatures count : {documentInfo.TextSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Image signatures count : {documentInfo.ImageSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Digital signatures count : {documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Barcode signatures count : {documentInfo.BarcodeSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- QrCode signatures count : {documentInfo.QrCodeSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- FormField signatures count : {documentInfo.FormFieldSignatures.Count}");

    // Output page details such as width and height for each page
    foreach (PageInfo pageInfo in documentInfo.Pages)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"- page-{pageInfo.PageNumber} Width {pageInfo.Width}, Height {pageInfo.Height}");
    }
}
```

### Breaking Down What This Code Actually Does

**Signature Object Creation**: The `Signature` object is your gateway to the document. Think of it as opening the document in a specialized viewer that can see not just the content, but all the metadata and signature information too.

**GetDocumentInfo Method**: This is where the magic happens. One method call gives you access to a wealth of information that would typically require multiple operations with other libraries.

**Basic Document Properties**: The first set of outputs shows you fundamental file characteristics:
- **Format and Extension**: Know exactly what type of file you're dealing with
- **Size**: Helpful for storage calculations and performance considerations  
- **Page Count**: Essential for pagination or processing workflows

**Signature Type Analysis**: This is particularly valuable for compliance and verification workflows. You can instantly see:
- How many digital signatures are present (crucial for legal validity)
- Whether there are form fields that might need completion
- If barcodes or QR codes are embedded (useful for tracking or automation)

**Page Dimension Details**: Getting width and height for each page helps with:
- Layout calculations for custom viewers
- Determining print settings
- Responsive display adjustments

## Common Issues and How to Solve Them

### File Path and Permission Problems
**Issue**: "File not found" or "Access denied" errors
**Solution**: 
- Double-check your file path—use absolute paths when possible
- Ensure your application has read permissions for the target directory
- For network paths, verify that the network location is accessible

### Memory and Performance Issues
**Issue**: Slow performance with large documents
**Solution**:
- Use `using` statements for proper resource disposal
- Consider processing documents asynchronously for better user experience
- For batch operations, implement proper error handling and logging

### Signature Detection Problems
**Issue**: Signature counts showing zero when you know signatures exist
**Solution**:
- Verify that signatures are properly embedded (not just visual elements)
- Check if the document format is supported for signature detection
- Some legacy signature formats might not be recognized—consider document conversion

### Format Compatibility Concerns
**Issue**: Unexpected format detection or errors with certain file types
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're using the latest version of GroupDocs.Signature
- Check the supported formats list in the documentation
- For problematic files, try opening them in their native applications first to verify integrity

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

### Document Management Systems
Imagine you're building a corporate document management system. You can automatically categorize documents based on their signature types—contracts go to legal review, invoices with digital signatures get fast-tracked for payment, and unsigned documents get flagged for completion.

### Legal and Compliance Software
Law firms can use this functionality to quickly audit case files, ensuring all required signatures are present before court submissions. The signature count feature helps verify that contracts meet specific requirements (like requiring two witness signatures).

### Archiving and Storage Solutions
Document archiving systems can optimize storage by analyzing page dimensions and signature complexity. High-resolution documents with multiple signatures might get compressed differently than simple text documents.

### Integration with CRM Platforms
Sales teams can automatically update deal statuses based on signature presence in contracts. When a contract PDF shows digital signatures from both parties, the CRM can automatically move the deal to "closed-won" status.

### Quality Assurance Workflows
Before processing batches of legal documents, QA teams can run automated checks to ensure all documents meet minimum requirements for signatures, page counts, and format standards.

## Performance Best Practices for Production Use

### Asynchronous Processing Strategies
When dealing with multiple documents, always process them asynchronously:
```csharp
public async Task<DocumentSummary> AnalyzeDocumentAsync(string filePath)
{
    return await Task.Run(() => {
        using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            var info = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
            return new DocumentSummary(info);
        }
    });
}
```

### Resource Management Guidelines
- Always use `using` statements with Signature objects
- Implement proper exception handling for file I/O operations
- Consider connection pooling if working with network storage
- Monitor memory usage when processing large batches

### Batch Processing Optimization
For high-volume scenarios:
- Process documents in parallel with careful thread management
- Implement retry logic for transient failures  
- Use progress tracking for long-running operations
- Consider breaking large batches into smaller chunks

### Caching Strategies
If you're repeatedly analyzing the same documents:
- Cache document info results with appropriate expiration
- Use file modification dates to invalidate cache entries
- Consider storing metadata in a database for quick lookups

## When to Use This Approach vs. Alternatives

**Choose GroupDocs.Signature when:**
- You need comprehensive signature analysis
- Working with multiple document formats
- Require detailed metadata extraction
- Building commercial applications with support needs

**Consider alternatives when:**
- You only need basic file properties (use built-in .NET file operations)
- Working exclusively with PDFs (specialized PDF libraries might be simpler)
- Budget constraints make licensing challenging

## Wrapping Up: Next Steps for Your Document Processing

You now have the complete toolkit for extracting document information using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This isn't just about getting file properties—it's about building intelligent document processing systems that can make decisions based on content structure and signature validity.

The key takeaway? One simple method call (`GetDocumentInfo()`) gives you enterprise-level document analysis capabilities that would otherwise require multiple libraries and complex integration work.

**Ready to implement this in your project?** Start with the basic example above, then gradually add error handling, async processing, and caching as your needs grow. The beauty of GroupDocs.Signature is that you can start simple and scale up without rewriting your core logic.
