# How to Retrieve Document Information with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

Managing and verifying document integrity is crucial when dealing with contracts or any signed documents. This tutorial guides you through extracting essential details from a document using **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**. By leveraging this library, developers can automate the process of managing digital signatures in their applications.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- How to set up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Retrieving basic document properties such as format, size, and page count
- Counting various signature types within a document
- Extracting detailed information about each page

Before diving into the implementation, let's go over the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To follow this tutorial, youâ€™ll need:
- **.NET Core 3.1** or later installed on your machine.

Ensure that your development environment is configured with the necessary tools like Visual Studio or any preferred IDE that supports .NET applications.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with C# programming and basic knowledge of handling files in a .NET environment will be beneficial. You should also have an understanding of digital signatures and their role in document management.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

### Installation Information
To integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your project, choose one of the following methods:

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version directly through your IDE.

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Start by downloading a free trial from [GroupDocs](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/). This allows you to explore the library's capabilities without any initial investment.
  
- **Temporary License**: If you need more time to evaluate, consider requesting a temporary license via [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

- **Purchase**: For commercial use, purchase a license from [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the `Signature` object with your document's path. This is essential for accessing various features of GroupDocs.Signature.

## Implementation Guide
This section walks you through retrieving basic information about a document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

### Retrieve Document Info
#### Overview
To understand the structure and content of a signed document, extract its metadata such as file type, size, and page count. This process is vital for applications that need to verify or index documents based on these attributes.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SampleSignedMulti";

// Initialize the Signature object with the document path
to (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Retrieve the document information using GetDocumentInfo method
    IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
    
    // Output basic properties of the document
    Console.WriteLine($"- format : {documentInfo.FileType.FileFormat}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- extension : {documentInfo.FileType.Extension}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- size : {documentInfo.Size}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- page count : {documentInfo.PageCount}");

    // Output counts of various signature types
    Console.WriteLine($"- Form Fields count : {documentInfo.FormFields.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Text signatures count : {documentInfo.TextSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Image signatures count : {documentInfo.ImageSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Digital signatures count : {documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- Barcode signatures count : {documentInfo.BarcodeSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- QrCode signatures count : {documentInfo.QrCodeSignatures.Count}");
    Console.WriteLine($"- FormField signatures count : {documentInfo.FormFieldSignatures.Count}");

    // Output page details such as width and height for each page
    foreach (PageInfo pageInfo in documentInfo.Pages)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"- page-{pageInfo.PageNumber} Width {pageInfo.Width}, Height {pageInfo.Height}");
    }
}
```
#### Explanation
- **Signature Object Initialization**: Start by creating an instance of the `Signature` class with the path to your document. This object acts as the gateway to accessing various document-related features.
- **GetDocumentInfo Method**: By invoking this method, you obtain a rich set of metadata about the document, which includes not only basic properties but also detailed information about any signatures present within.
- **Outputting Document Properties**: The retrieved `IDocumentInfo` object provides access to numerous details such as file format, extension, size, and page count. This is useful for logging or processing documents based on their characteristics.
- **Signature Counters**: Understanding the number of different signature types in a document can be crucial for validation processes. Each type (text, image, digital, etc.) serves a specific purpose, and knowing their counts helps in verifying completeness.
- **Page Information**: Accessing each page's dimensions allows applications to adjust layouts or perform operations that are dependent on page size.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the document path is correctly specified; otherwise, an exception may be thrown.
- Verify that all necessary permissions for reading files are set up in your environment.
- If encountering issues with signature counts, confirm that signatures are correctly embedded in the document format being used.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automate the organization and retrieval of documents based on metadata.
2. **Legal Software**: Validate contracts by checking for all necessary digital signatures before processing.
3. **Archiving Solutions**: Use page size information to optimize storage formats or layouts.
4. **Content Verification Tools**: Implement systems that ensure all required signature types are present in a document.
5. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Enhance customer records with verified and indexed signed documents.

## Performance Considerations
To maintain optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Signature, consider these best practices:
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Where possible, handle I/O operations asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread.
- **Resource Management**: Dispose of `Signature` objects appropriately after use to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: When dealing with multiple documents, process them in batches rather than one-by-one to reduce overhead.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to retrieve basic document information using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This feature is invaluable for applications that require detailed insights into signed documents, facilitating better management and verification processes. To further explore the capabilities of GroupDocs.Signature, consider experimenting with additional features such as adding or verifying signatures.
