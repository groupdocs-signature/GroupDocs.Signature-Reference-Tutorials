# How to Implement Encrypted Metadata Signatures with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

In today's digital age, ensuring the security and authenticity of documents is paramount. Whether you're dealing with contracts, legal agreements, or any other sensitive information, encryption plays a crucial role in protecting your data from unauthorized access. This guide will walk you through implementing encrypted metadata signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, a robust library designed to simplify document signing processes.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to create custom metadata signature classes
- Encrypting metadata signatures for enhanced security
- Setting up and initializing GroupDocs.Signature for .NET in your project
- Practical examples of encrypted metadata signatures

With this tutorial, you'll gain the skills needed to integrate secure signing functionalities into your applications. Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Libraries and Versions**: You'll need GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, which can be installed via .NET CLI or Package Manager.
- **Environment Setup**: A .NET environment (preferably .NET Core 3.1 or later) is required.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with C# programming and basic understanding of encryption concepts will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To begin, you need to install the GroupDocs.Signature library in your project. Here are different methods to do so:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Signature, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a free trial to test the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full feature access during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Buy a license for long-term usage.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your application. Hereâ€™s a basic setup:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize Signature instance
Signature signature = new Signature("sample.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into two main features: creating custom metadata signatures and encrypting them.

### Feature 1: Custom Data Signature Class

**Overview**: This feature allows you to define a custom data class for storing signature metadata, which can be serialized and included in your document signatures.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Create the `DocumentSignatureData` Class

Start by defining a class that holds your metadata:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

public class DocumentSignatureData
{
    [Format("SignID")]
    public string ID { get; set; }

    [Format("SAuth")]
    public string Author { get; set; }

    [Format("SDate", "yyyy-MM-dd")]
    public DateTime Signed { get; set; }

    [Format("SDFact", "N2")]
    public decimal DataFactor { get; set; }

    [SkipSerialization]
    public string Comments { get; set; }
}
```

- **Explanation**: Each property is annotated with `Format` to define how it should appear in the metadata. The `Comments` field is excluded from serialization using `[SkipSerialization]`.

### Feature 2: Metadata Signature with Encryption

**Overview**: This feature demonstrates signing a document with encrypted metadata, enhancing security by ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and read the signature data.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Encrypting Metadata Signatures

1. **Setup Key and Passphrase**

   Define your encryption key and salt:

   ```csharp
   string key = "1234567890";
   string salt = "1234567890";
   ```

2. **Create Data Encryption Object**

   Use symmetric encryption to encrypt your metadata:

   ```csharp
   IDataEncryption encryption = new SymmetricEncryption(SymmetricAlgorithmType.Rijndael, key, salt);
   ```

3. **Configure Metadata Sign Options**

   Set up the signing options and associate them with the encryption object:

   ```csharp
   MetadataSignOptions options = new MetadataSignOptions()
   {
       DataEncryption = encryption
   };
   ```

4. **Create Custom Signature Data Object**

   Instantiate your custom metadata class:

   ```csharp
   DocumentSignatureData documentSignatureData = new DocumentSignatureData()
   {
       ID = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
       Author = Environment.UserName,
       Signed = DateTime.Now,
       DataFactor = 11.22M
   };
   ```

5. **Define Metadata Signatures**

   Create and add metadata signatures to your options:

   ```csharp
   WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdSignature = new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("Signature", documentSignatureData);
   WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdAuthor = new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("Author", "Mr.Scherlock Holmes");
   WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdDocId = new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("DocumentId", Guid.NewGuid().ToString());

   options.Add(mdSignature).Add(mdAuthor).Add(mdDocId);
   ```

6. **Sign the Document**

   Finally, sign your document and save it:

   ```csharp
   SignResult signResult = signature.Sign("output.docx", options);
   ```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for encrypted metadata signatures:

1. **Legal Contracts**: Securely sign contracts with metadata that includes signer information and timestamps.
2. **Financial Documents**: Protect sensitive financial data by encrypting metadata related to transactions.
3. **Healthcare Records**: Ensure patient confidentiality by signing documents with encrypted metadata.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET:

- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage, especially when processing large batches of documents.
- **Best Practices**: Dispose of Signature objects properly to free up resources.
- **Optimization Tips**: Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve application responsiveness.
