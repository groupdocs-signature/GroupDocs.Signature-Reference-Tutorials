# How to Implement Electronic Document Signing in .NET with GroupDocs.Signature: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Have you ever needed a reliable way to securely sign documents electronically? This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through implementing electronic document signing using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Whether you're operating in trial mode or have applied a license, this guide ensures secure and efficient handling of digital signatures across various document types.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to sign documents electronically with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Differences between running in trial mode vs. applying a license
- Step-by-step implementation for both modes
- Practical applications and performance considerations

Let's explore how this powerful library can simplify your document signing process.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the necessary setup:
- **Libraries & Dependencies**: GroupDocs.Signature for .NET (version 21.10 or later recommended)
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2019 or later
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of C# and .NET development

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

### Installation Instructions

To get started, you'll need to install the GroupDocs.Signature library. You can do this through various methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Through NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

Acquiring a license is straightforward. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license if you're evaluating the full capabilities of the product. For production environments, consider purchasing a license to unlock all features and receive support.

**Steps to Acquire License:**
1. **Free Trial**: Download from [GroupDocs Release Page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. **Temporary License**: Apply for one via [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: Buy a license through the [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

To initialize GroupDocs.Signature, create an instance of the `Signature` class and set any necessary configurations.

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("your_file_path"))
{
    // Your signing logic here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This guide is divided into two main sections: running in trial mode and applying a license. Each section will walk you through the specific steps needed to implement document signing with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

### Signing Documents in Trial Mode

**Overview**: In this feature, we demonstrate how to sign documents without applying a full license, allowing you to test the library's capabilities in trial mode.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Prepare File Paths

```csharp
List<string> files = new List<string>
{
    "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF",
    "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IMAGE",
    "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET",
    "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PRESENTATION",
    "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_WORDPROCESSING"
};

string trialOutPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "LicenceUsing", "Trial");
```

##### 2. Sign Each Document

Iterate through the files and sign each one using a predefined method.

```csharp
foreach (string item in files)
{
    string fileName = Path.GetFileName(item);
    string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(trialOutPath, fileName);
    SignFile(item, outputFilePath);  // Call method to sign document in trial mode
}
```

##### 3. Define the Signing Method

Implement the `SignFile` method to apply a digital signature.

```csharp
class SignatureExample
{
    private static void SignFile(string filePath, string outputFilePath)
    {
        using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
            {
                // Set signature representation as an image
                SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Image,
                Left = 100, 
                Top = 100,   
                Width = 100, 
                Height = 30, 
                ForeColor = Color.Red, 
                Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Comic Sans MS" }
            };

            // Sign the document and save it to the specified path
            SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Configurations:**
- `TextSignOptions`: Defines how the text signature will appear.
- `SignatureImplementation`: Use an image for visual representation.
- Positioning (Left, Top), Size (Width, Height), and styling parameters like ForeColor and Font.

### Applying License for Document Signing

**Overview**: This feature shows you how to apply a license before signing documents to unlock full capabilities without trial restrictions.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Set Up the License

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

License lic = new License();
lic.SetLicense("YOUR_LICENSE_PATH"); // Apply the license using the provided path
```

##### 2. Sign Documents with License

Utilize a similar file iteration process as in trial mode, but ensure the license is set before signing.

```csharp
string licenseOutPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "LicenceUsing", "License");
foreach (string item in files)
{
    string fileName = Path.GetFileName(item);
    string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(licenseOutPath, fileName);
    SignFile(item, outputFilePath);  // Call method to sign document with license
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure the license file path is correct.
- Verify that your GroupDocs.Signature version matches the license requirements.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET can be integrated into various real-world scenarios, such as:
1. **Automating Invoice Approvals**: Streamline financial workflows by automating signature processes on invoices.

3. **Legal Document Processing**: Securely sign legal documents without physical presence.
4. **Event Registration Forms**: Automate signing of registration forms for events and conferences.
5. **Educational Certifications**: Digitally sign academic certificates and transcripts.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Optimize document processing by handling smaller batches or utilizing multi-threading where applicable.
- Monitor resource usage to prevent excessive memory consumption, especially with large files.
- Follow .NET best practices for memory management, such as disposing of objects promptly.
