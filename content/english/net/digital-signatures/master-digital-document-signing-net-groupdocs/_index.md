- Access to a text editor like Visual Studio Code or any IDE of your choice
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET application structure
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
Before we can start signing documents, you'll need to add the GroupDocs.Signature library to your project. Let's walk through this process:
### Installation Instructions
**Using .NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```
**With Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```
**NuGet Package Manager UI:**

### License Acquisition Steps
To fully utilize GroupDocs.Signature, you need to acquire a license. Hereâ€™s how:
1. **Free Trial**: Download a trial package from [GroupDocs' release page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/) to explore features.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for testing purposes by visiting the [temporary license page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For full capabilities, purchase a license at [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
### Basic Initialization and Setup
To start using GroupDocs.Signature in your project, initialize it as follows:
```csharp
// Initialize the Signature object with the document path
using (Signature signature = new Signature("SampleForm.docx"))
{
    // Your code to sign documents will go here
}
```
## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the implementation into logical sections based on features.
### Signing a Document with Text Form Field
This feature allows you to insert text signatures directly into existing form fields of your document, automating the signing process efficiently.
#### Step 1: Define Your Document and Output Path
Firstly, set up paths for your input and output documents:
```csharp
// Define constants for directories (replace with your paths)
const string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "C:\\Documents";
const string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "C:\\Output";

string filePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY, "SampleForm.docx");
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, "SignedDocument.docx");
```
#### Step 2: Configure Text Signature Options
Next, configure your text signature options. Customize the appearance and placement of the signature:
```csharp
// Create a TextSignOptions object with desired settings
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Doe")
{
    // Specify the form field name if applicable
    FieldName = "SignatureField",
    
    // Set position on the page (optional)
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```
#### Step 3: Sign the Document
Finally, apply your signature to the document:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Apply the text signature to the form field
    signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Form Fields**: Ensure that your document contains the correct form fields before attempting to sign.
- **File Path Issues**: Double-check file paths and ensure necessary permissions are set.
## Practical Applications
Integrating GroupDocs.Signature offers numerous benefits across different sectors:
1. **Contract Management**: Automatically populate contract templates with signatures, reducing manual errors.
2. **Real Estate**: Streamline property agreements by enabling digital signing of lease documents.
3. **HR and Recruitment**: Expedite hiring processes by facilitating quick e-signing of job offer letters.
## Performance Considerations
When working with large volumes of documents or high-resolution images:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects appropriately.
- Utilize asynchronous programming to enhance application responsiveness.
