```csharp
using (var signature = new Signature("your-file-path.pdf"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s delve into the core functionality of generating a digital signature preview.

### Setting Up Digital Signature Options

Begin by configuring your digital signature options. This section will guide you through setting up each parameter to ensure your signature is both functional and visually appealing.

#### 1. Define Certificate Path and Password
Specify the path to your digital certificate file and its password:

```csharp
string certificatePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/CertificatePfx"; // Placeholder path for the digital certificate.
```

#### 2. Configure Signature Appearance
Customize how your signature will appear in the document using the `Appearance` property:

```csharp
Appearance = new Options.Appearances.PdfDigitalSignatureAppearance()
{
    ContactInfoLabel = "Contact",
    ReasonLabel = "R:",
    LocationLabel = "@⇒",
    DigitalSignedLabel = "By:",
    DateSignedAtLabel = "On:",
    Background = Color.LightGray,
    FontFamilyName = "Courier",
    FontSize = 8
},
```

#### 3. Set Signature Details
Provide details like reason for signing, contact information, and location:

```csharp
Reason = "Approved",           // Signature reason.
Contact = "John Smith",        // Signer's contact information.
Location = "New York",         // Signing location.
```

#### 4. Configure Positioning and Margins
Adjust the signature's position within your document with alignment and margin settings:

```csharp
VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
Margin = new Padding() { Bottom = 10, Right = 10 },
```

#### 5. Define Border Appearance
Set border visibility and style for a polished look:

```csharp
Border = new Border()
{
    Visible = true,
    Color = Color.FromArgb(80, Color.DarkGray),
    DashStyle = DashStyle.DashDot,
    Weight = 2
};
```

### Generating the Signature Preview

Use the `PreviewSignatureOptions` to create a visual preview:

```csharp
PreviewSignatureOptions previewOption = new PreviewSignatureOptions(signOptions, CreateSignatureStream, ReleaseSignatureStream)
{
    SignatureId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    PreviewFormat = PreviewSignatureOptions.PreviewFormats.JPEG
};

Signature.GenerateSignaturePreview(previewOption);
```

### Stream Handling

Implement methods to handle signature streams:

#### Creating the Signature Stream

```csharp
private static Stream CreateSignatureStream(PreviewSignatureOptions previewOptions)
{
    string imageFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "GenerateSignaturePreviewAdvanced", $"signature-{previewOptions.SignatureId}-{previewOptions.SignOptions.SignatureType}.jpg");
    var folder = Path.GetDirectoryName(imageFilePath);
    if (!Directory.Exists(folder))
    {
        Directory.CreateDirectory(folder);
    }
    return new FileStream(imageFilePath, FileMode.Create);
}
```

#### Releasing the Signature Stream

```csharp
private static void ReleaseSignatureStream(PreviewSignatureOptions previewOptions, Stream signatureStream)
{
    signatureStream.Dispose();
}
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where generating a digital signature preview can be particularly useful:

1. **Document Review Process**: Provides stakeholders with a visual of the finalized document before official signing.
2. **Legal Contracts**: Ensures clarity and agreement on terms by previewing signatures in contracts.
3. **Academic Certifications**: Offers students a preview of their signed certificates for verification purposes.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Use efficient stream handling to manage memory usage effectively.
- Minimize the use of large digital certificates when possible to enhance performance.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Always close streams after operations to free up resources promptly.

### Best Practices
- Profile your application regularly to identify and resolve potential bottlenecks in signature processing.
