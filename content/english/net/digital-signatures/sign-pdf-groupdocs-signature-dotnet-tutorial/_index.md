### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- **.NET Core SDK** or .NET Framework installed (version 4.7.2 or later).
- Basic understanding of C# and the .NET environment setup.
- Visual Studio or any preferred IDE that supports .NET development.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To get started with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you need to install the library in your project. Here are the installation methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" in your IDE's NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize the Signature object
var signature = new Signature("sample.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Signing PDF with Text Signature

This section will guide you through signing a PDF document using a text signature.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

First, set up your input and output file paths:

```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf");
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithText", fileName);
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Signature Object

Create a `Signature` object using your input file path:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Further steps will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Text Sign Options

Configure the text sign options with necessary parameters like position, size, and appearance:

```csharp
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
{
    Left = 50,
    Top = 200,
    Width = 100,
    Height = 30,
    ForeColor = Color.Red,
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 14, FamilyName = "Comic Sans MS" }
};
```

- **Left** and **Top**: Set the X and Y coordinates for where the signature will appear.
- **Width** and **Height**: Define the size of the text box containing your signature.
- **ForeColor**: Specify the color of the text.
- **Font**: Customize font properties, including size and family.

#### Step 4: Apply the Signature

Finally, apply the text signature to the PDF and save it:

```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that your file paths are correctly specified.
- Check if you have write permissions for the output directory.
- Validate that all necessary dependencies are installed.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where signing PDFs with text can be beneficial:

1. **Contract Management**: Streamline contract approvals by allowing digital signatures.
2. **Invoices and Receipts**: Quickly sign financial documents electronically.
3. **Legal Documents**: Simplify the process of signing legal papers.
4. **Educational Certificates**: Digitally sign academic certificates for faster distribution.

Integration possibilities with other systems include automating document workflows, integrating with CRM or ERP systems, and using cloud storage solutions to manage signed documents.

When working with GroupDocs.Signature in a .NET environment, consider the following:

- **Optimizing Performance**: Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
- **Resource Usage Guidelines**: Monitor memory usage to prevent leaks when handling large batches of documents.
- **Memory Management Best Practices**: Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements or explicit disposal.
