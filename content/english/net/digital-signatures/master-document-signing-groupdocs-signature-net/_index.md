```

If this compiles without errors, you're ready to start implementing document signing features.

## Core Implementation Guide

### Sign Documents with Text Signatures

This is where the magic happens. You'll learn how to add professional-looking text signatures to any supported document format.

#### When You'd Actually Use This

Think about these real-world scenarios:
- **Contract automation**: Automatically add company signatures to approved contracts
- **Invoice processing**: Sign invoices with authorized personnel names
- **Document workflows**: Add approval signatures at different workflow stages
- **Compliance tracking**: Insert audit signatures with timestamps

#### The Complete Implementation

Here's how to sign a document with a customizable text signature:

**Step 1: Set up your file paths and basic configuration**
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Your source document
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedDocument.docx");
```

**Step 2: Configure your text signature with professional styling**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    TextSignOptions signOptions = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
    {
        // Position the signature exactly where you want it
        VerticalAlignment = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.VerticalAlignment.Top,
        HorizontalAlignment = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.HorizontalAlignment.Center,
        Width = 100,
        Height = 40,
        Margin = new Padding(20),
        
        // Make it look professional
        ForeColor = Color.Red,
        Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Comic Sans MS" }
    };
```

**Step 3: Execute the signing and handle results**
```csharp
    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, signOptions);
    
    // Always verify your results
    foreach (BaseSignature temp in signResult.Succeeded)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Signed Text Signature: Id:{temp.SignatureId}, Location: {temp.Left}x{temp.Top}. Size: {temp.Width}x{temp.Height}");
    }
}
```

#### Pro Configuration Tips

**Font choices matter**: Avoid Comic Sans MS in production (seriously). Stick with professional fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri.

**Positioning strategy**: Use specific coordinates for consistent placement across document batches:
```csharp
signOptions.Left = 50;  // Exact pixel positioning
signOptions.Top = 100;
```

**Color considerations**: Red might grab attention, but consider your brand colors or legal requirements. Many legal documents require black signatures.

### Verify Document Signatures (Critical for Compliance)

Signature verification isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential for legal validity and compliance. Here's how to implement bulletproof verification.

#### Why Verification Matters

In legal contexts, you need to prove:
- The signature exists and is intact
- The document hasn't been modified after signing
- The signature matches expected criteria

#### Step-by-Step Verification Implementation

**Step 1: Point to your signed document**
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to the signed document
```

**Step 2: Configure verification criteria**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    TextVerifyOptions verifyOptions = new TextVerifyOptions()
    {
        AllPages = false,        // Check specific page for performance
        PageNumber = 1,          // Which page to verify
        Text = "John Smith",     // Exact text to match
        MatchType = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.TextMatchType.Exact
    };
```

**Step 3: Execute verification and handle results properly**
```csharp
    VerificationResult verifyResult = signature.Verify(verifyOptions);
    
    if (verifyResult.IsValid)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document was verified successfully!");
        // Log this for audit trails
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document failed verification process.");
        // Handle this as a security concern
    }
}
```

#### Common Verification Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

**Case sensitivity issues**: The `Text` property must match exactly, including capitalization. Consider using `TextMatchType.Contains` for more flexible matching.

**Page numbering mistakes**: Remember that page numbers start at 1, not 0. Double-check this in multi-page documents.

**Performance optimization**: Set `AllPages = false` and specify `PageNumber` when you know where signatures are located. Scanning all pages is expensive for large documents.

### Search for Existing Signatures

Sometimes you need to find signatures without knowing exactly where they are. This is crucial for document analysis and audit scenarios.

#### Real-World Use Cases

- **Audit compliance**: Find all signatures by a specific person
- **Document analysis**: Catalog all signatures in a document collection
- **Workflow validation**: Ensure all required signatures are present

#### Implementation That Actually Works

**Step 1: Set up your search scope**
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Document to search
```

**Step 2: Configure flexible search options**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    TextSearchOptions searchOptions = new TextSearchOptions()
    {
        AllPages = true,    // Search entire document
        MatchType = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.TextMatchType.Exact,
        Text = "John Smith" // What you're looking for
    };
```

**Step 3: Process search results efficiently**
```csharp
    List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(searchOptions);
    
    foreach (TextSignature textSignature in signatures)
    {
        if (textSignature != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Found Text signature at page {textSignature.PageNumber} with type [{textSignature.SignatureImplementation}] and text '{textSignature.Text}'. Location: {textSignature.Left}-{textSignature.Top}. Size is {textSignature.Width}x{textSignature.Height}.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Search Performance Tips

**Use specific search criteria**: Broad searches on large documents can be slow. Be as specific as possible with your `Text` parameter.

**Consider MatchType options**: 
- `Exact`: Fastest but inflexible
- `Contains`: Good balance of speed and flexibility
- `StartsWith`: Useful for finding signature prefixes

### Update Existing Signatures

Business requirements change, and sometimes you need to modify existing signatures without re-signing the entire document.

#### When to Update vs. Re-sign

**Update when**: 
- Correcting formatting (size, position)
- Changing appearance without changing validity
- Adjusting signatures for different output formats

**Re-sign when**: 
- The signature content changes
- Legal requirements change
- Moving to a different signing authority

#### Safe Update Implementation

**Step 1: Identify signatures to update**
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Your signed document
List<string> signatureIds = new List<string>(); // Populate this with valid IDs
```

**Step 2: Configure update parameters**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    foreach (var item in signatureIds)
    {
        TextSignature temp = new TextSignature(item)
        {
            Width = 150,    // New dimensions
            Height = 50,
            HorizontalAlignment = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.HorizontalAlignment.Right
        };
```

**Step 3: Execute updates with proper error handling**
```csharp
        SignResult signResult = signature.UpdateSignatures(temp);
        
        if (signResult.Succeeded.Count > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Updated Text Signature: Id:{temp.SignatureId}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Failed to update signature: Id:{temp.SignatureId}");
            // Handle the failure appropriately
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Tips and Best Practices

### Performance Optimization for High-Volume Scenarios

When you're processing hundreds or thousands of documents, these optimizations make a huge difference:

**Memory Management**
```csharp
// Always use 'using' statements to ensure proper disposal
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your signing logic here
} // Automatically disposes resources
```

**Batch Processing Strategy**
- Process documents in batches of 50-100 to balance memory usage and throughput
- Use parallel processing for independent documents
- Cache signature configurations to avoid repeated object creation

**File I/O Optimization**
- Use local storage for processing, then move to final destination
- Consider in-memory streams for small documents
- Implement retry logic for network storage scenarios

### Security Considerations You Can't Ignore

**Signature Integrity**
- Always verify signatures after creating them
- Implement checksum validation for critical documents
- Log all signature operations for audit trails

**Access Control**
- Never hardcode signature credentials in your code
- Use secure credential storage (Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Implement proper authentication before allowing signature operations

**Document Chain of Custody**
- Track who signed what and when
- Maintain original documents separately from signed versions
- Implement version control for document workflows

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

**File Path Issues**
The most common problem? Incorrect file paths. Always validate file existence before processing:
```csharp
if (!File.Exists(filePath))
{
    throw new FileNotFoundException($"Document not found: {filePath}");
}
```

**Signature Positioning Problems**
Test your positioning logic with different document formats. What works for PDF might not work for DOCX.

**License Validation**
Always check your license status in production applications. Expired licenses cause runtime failures.

**Thread Safety**
The Signature class isn't thread-safe by default. If you're using multi-threading, create separate instances for each thread.

## When to Use Different Signature Approaches

### Text Signatures vs. Digital Certificates

**Use text signatures for**:
- Internal document workflows
- Non-legal approval processes
- Quick identification and tracking
- High-volume automated processes

**Use digital certificates for**:
- Legal contracts requiring non-repudiation
- Regulatory compliance scenarios
- Documents that need cryptographic validation
- External partner communications

### Performance vs. Security Trade-offs

**High-performance scenarios** (internal workflows):
- Use simple text signatures
- Skip complex verification on trusted documents
- Process in batches with minimal logging

**High-security scenarios** (legal documents):
- Use cryptographic signatures
- Implement full verification chains
- Maintain detailed audit logs
- Use secure timestamp servers
