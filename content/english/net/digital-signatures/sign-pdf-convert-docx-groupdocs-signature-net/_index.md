## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through the process of signing a PDF and converting it into DOCX format.

### Feature: Sign PDF Document and Save as Different File Type

#### Overview
Digitally sign a PDF document using a QR code and save the signed version in DOCX format, ensuring security and compatibility across applications.

##### Step 1: Initialize Signature Object
Start by initializing the `Signature` class with your source PDF file path.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Set the path for the source PDF file. Replace with your document directory.
string filePath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Configure Sign Options
Create `QrCodeSignOptions` to specify signature details like text, encoding type, and position.
```csharp
// Create QRCode sign options with predefined text as a signature.
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR, // Set the encoding type for the QR code.
    Left = 100,   // Position the signature at x-coordinate: 100
    Top = 100     // Position the signature at y-coordinate: 100
};
```

##### Step 3: Configure Save Options
Define `PdfSaveOptions` to specify that you want the output in DOCX format and enable file overwriting.
```csharp
// Configure PDF save options for output format and overwrite behavior.
PdfSaveOptions pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions()
{
    FileFormat = PdfSaveFileFormat.DocX,   // Specify the saved file should be in DOCX format.
    OverwriteExistingFiles = true          // Allow overwriting if a file with the same name exists.
};
```

##### Step 4: Sign and Save the Document
Use the `Sign` method to apply the signature and save it as DOCX.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Sign the document and save it to the specified output file path.
    string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedDocument.docx");
    SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, signOptions, pdfSaveOptions);
}
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found**: Ensure your directory paths are correct and accessible.
- **Permission Issues**: Verify file system permissions for reading and writing files.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Signature's ability to handle multiple formats makes it versatile. Here are a few use cases:
1. **Legal Document Signing**: Sign contracts quickly and convert them into editable DOCX formats for further modifications.
2. **HR Agreements**: Manage employee agreements by signing PDFs and converting them to DOCX for easy distribution.
3. **Educational Certificates**: Sign certificates in PDF format and offer them as DOCX files for printing or sharing.

Integration with other systems, like CRM or document management solutions, can further enhance workflow efficiency.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is key when handling large batches of documents:
- Use asynchronous methods if available to improve responsiveness.
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of resources appropriately after use.
- Batch process files where possible to reduce overhead.

Adhering to these practices ensures smooth operations and optimal resource usage with GroupDocs.Signature.
