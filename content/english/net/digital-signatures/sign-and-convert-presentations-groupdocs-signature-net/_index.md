}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Signing a Presentation and Saving as Different File Type

Add digital signatures to presentations and save them in different formats:

#### Create QRCodeSignOptions
Define the properties of your QR code signature using `QrCodeSignOptions`:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Define QR code signature options
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100, // Horizontal position on the page
    Top = 100   // Vertical position on the page
};
```

#### Set PresentationSaveOptions
Specify how you want to save your signed document using `PresentationSaveOptions`:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

// Configure save options for the signed presentation
PresentationSaveOptions saveOptions = new PresentationSaveOptions()
{
    FileFormat = PresentationSaveFileFormat.Tiff,
    OverwriteExistingFiles = true
};
```

#### Sign and Save
Sign your document and save it in the desired format:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Perform signing and saving process
SignResult result = signature.Sign("output/path", signOptions, saveOptions);
```

### Setting Up Document Paths
Properly set paths for input and output files:

```csharp
string sourceDocumentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample_Document.docx");
string signedOutputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedDocuments", "Signed_Document.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Corporate Contracts**: Automate signing and conversion of contracts.
2. **Educational Materials**: Securely sign and convert presentations for distribution.
3. **Legal Documents**: Streamline the process of signing legal documents in various formats.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure smooth implementation:
- Optimize file handling by managing memory usage effectively.
- Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
