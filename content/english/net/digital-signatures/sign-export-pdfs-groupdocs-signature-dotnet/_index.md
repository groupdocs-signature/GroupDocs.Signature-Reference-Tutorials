### Environment Setup Requirements

- A suitable IDE like Visual Studio
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming

### Knowledge Prerequisites

- Familiarity with handling files in .NET applications
- Understanding of basic PDF manipulation concepts

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To get started, you'll need to install the **GroupDocs.Signature** library. Here are a few ways to do it:

### Installation Options

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

After installation, initialize your project with GroupDocs.Signature by creating an instance of `Signature` and providing the path to your document. This sets the stage for signing your documents.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Sign Document

This feature focuses on adding a QR code signature to your PDF document.

#### Overview

We'll use GroupDocs.Signature to embed a QR code into a PDF, useful for verification purposes or embedding metadata.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Initialize Signature Object

Create an instance of the `Signature` class with the path to your document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code will go here
}
```

##### Create QR Code Sign Options

Define the QR code's properties, such as content and position:

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```

##### Sign the Document

Invoke the `Sign` method to apply your signature:

```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign();
```

#### Key Configuration Options

- **EncodeType**: Specifies the QR code type.
- **Left & Top**: Define the position of the QR code on the document.

### Feature 2: Export Signed Document as Image

Next, let's export your signed PDF as an image file.

#### Overview

This feature allows you to convert a signed PDF into an image format, making it easier to share or display.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Define Sign and Export Options

Set up the QR code sign options along with image export settings:

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};

ExportImageSaveOptions exportImageSaveOptions = new ExportImageSaveOptions(ImageSaveFileFormat.Png)
{
    Border = new Border() { Color = Color.Brown, Weight = 5, DashStyle = DashStyle.Solid, Transparency = 0.5 },
    PagesSetup = new PagesSetup() { FirstPage = true, LastPage = true },
    PageColumns = 2
};
```

##### Sign and Export

Use the `Sign` method to apply your signature and export:

```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, signOptions, exportImageSaveOptions);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified.
- Check for write permissions in the output directory.

## Practical Applications

1. **Contract Management**: Automate signing contracts with embedded metadata for tracking.
2. **Document Verification**: Use QR codes to verify document authenticity quickly.
3. **Marketing Materials**: Sign promotional PDFs and convert them into shareable images.
4. **Legal Documentation**: Securely sign legal documents and export them for easy distribution.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance:

- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects after use.
- Use asynchronous methods where applicable to improve responsiveness.
- Monitor resource usage during batch processing tasks.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to sign PDFs with QR codes using GroupDocs.Signature and export them as images. These skills can enhance your document management processes significantly. For further exploration, consider integrating this functionality into larger applications or exploring additional features of the GroupDocs library.
