# How to Track Your Document's Signature History in .NET

## What Can GroupDocs.Signature Do for You?

Ever wondered what happened to that contract after you sent it out for signatures? With GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you'll never lose track again. This powerful library transforms how you manage document signatures within your .NET applications, giving you complete visibility into your document's journey.

Whether you're handling contracts, agreements, or any paperwork requiring signatures, GroupDocs.Signature helps you keep tabs on every action taken. Let's explore how you can easily access and understand your document's processing history.

## Getting Started: What You'll Need

Before we dive in, let's make sure you have everything ready:

1. Install the Library: Download and install GroupDocs.Signature for .NET from the [releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Prepare Your Document: Have a document ready in a supported format like PDF, DOCX, or others.
3. Basic C# Knowledge: You'll need to understand C# fundamentals to follow along with our examples.

Once you've checked these boxes, you're all set to start tracking your document's history!

## Essential Namespaces for Your Project

First things first—you'll need to import the right namespaces to access all the features:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```

These imports give you access to the core functionality we'll be using throughout this guide.

## Step 1: Where's Your Document?

Let's start by telling the program which document you want to examine:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string filePath = "sample_history.docx";
```

Remember to replace "sample_history.docx" with the path to your actual document. This could be a contract you've sent out or any document that's gone through the signature process.

## Step 2: Connect to Your Document

Now, let's establish a connection to your document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
```

This line creates a new Signature object that links to your document. The "using" statement ensures everything gets cleaned up properly when you're done.

## Step 3: What's Inside Your Document?

Time to peek inside and grab the document's information:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
```

This simple command retrieves all the available information about your document, including its complete processing history.

## Step 4: Reveal the Document's Journey

Now for the exciting part—seeing exactly what's happened to your document:

```csharp
foreach (ProcessLog processLog in documentInfo.ProcessLogs)
{
    Console.WriteLine($" - operation [{processLog.Type}] on {processLog.Date.ToShortDateString()}. Succeeded/Failed {processLog.Succeeded}/{processLog.Failed}. Message: {processLog.Message}");
}
```

This code loops through each entry in your document's processing history and displays it in a readable format. You'll see:
- What type of operation was performed
- When it happened
- Whether it succeeded or failed
- Any messages associated with the action

Imagine being able to see that John signed the document on Tuesday, but Mary's signature failed on Wednesday because of an authentication issue. That's the kind of insight you'll gain!
