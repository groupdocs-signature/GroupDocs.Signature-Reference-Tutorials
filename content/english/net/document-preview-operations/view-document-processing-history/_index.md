## Introduction
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful library that facilitates document processing by enabling you to manage and manipulate document signatures seamlessly within your .NET applications. Whether you're dealing with contracts, agreements, or any other type of document requiring signatures, GroupDocs.Signature empowers you to streamline your workflow efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into utilizing GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to view document processing history, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Installation: Make sure you have installed the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library. You can download it from the [releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Document Preparation: Have a document ready for processing. Ensure it's in a supported format like DOCX, PDF, or others.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with the basics of C# programming language as we'll be using it to interact with the GroupDocs.Signature library.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Here's how you can do it:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```
## Step 1: Define File Path
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string filePath = "sample_history.docx";
```
In this step, you specify the path to the document for which you want to view the processing history. Make sure to replace `"sample_history.docx"` with the actual path to your document.
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
```
Here, you initialize a new instance of the `Signature` class by passing the file path of the document as a parameter. The `using` statement ensures proper resource disposal after the task is completed.
## Step 3: Get Document Information
```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
```
This step retrieves information about the document, including its processing history, using the `GetDocumentInfo()` method of the `Signature` object.
## Step 4: Display Processing History
```csharp
foreach (ProcessLog processLog in documentInfo.ProcessLogs)
{
    Console.WriteLine($" - operation [{processLog.Type}] on {processLog.Date.ToShortDateString()}. Succeeded/Failed {processLog.Succeeded}/{processLog.Failed}. Message: {processLog.Message}");
}
```
In this final step, you iterate through the processing logs obtained from the document information and display them in a readable format. Each log entry includes details such as the type of operation performed, date of operation, success/failure status, and any associated messages.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET simplifies document processing tasks by providing robust features to manage document signatures efficiently. With the ability to view document processing history, users can track the progress of operations and ensure smooth workflow management.
