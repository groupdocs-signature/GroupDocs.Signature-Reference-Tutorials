# How to Retrieve Document Information Using GroupDocs.Signature

## Introduction

Have you ever struggled with extracting crucial information from your documents programmatically? If so, you're not alone. In today's digital world, document management is a critical aspect of many business workflows, and getting accurate document information can save you hours of manual work.

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET provides a powerful solution that makes this process straightforward. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to retrieve comprehensive document information—from basic properties to detailed signature data—all with just a few lines of code.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. GroupDocs.Signature Installation: Download and install the package from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. .NET Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment set up.
3. Sample Document: Have a test document ready (we'll use "sample_multiple_signatures.docx" in our examples).

## Importing Required Namespaces

First things first—let's import the necessary namespaces to access all the functionality we need:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```

## How Do You Extract Document Information?

Let's break this down into simple steps:

### Step 1: Define Your Document Path

Start by specifying where your document is located:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
```

### Step 2: Create a Signature Instance

Now, let's initialize the Signature object with our document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // We'll add more code here in the next steps
}
```

### Step 3: Retrieve the Document Information

This is where the magic happens—with just one line of code, you can access all the document's details:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
```

### Step 4: Display Document Properties

Let's output the information we've retrieved to see what we're working with:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Document properties {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}:");
Console.WriteLine($" - format : {documentInfo.FileType.FileFormat}");
Console.WriteLine($" - extension : {documentInfo.FileType.Extension}");
Console.WriteLine($" - size : {documentInfo.Size}");
Console.WriteLine($" - page count : {documentInfo.PageCount}");
```

### Step 5: Explore Signature Details

One of the most valuable features is the ability to count various signature types in your document:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($" - Form Fields count : {documentInfo.FormFields.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Text signatures count : {documentInfo.TextSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Image signatures count : {documentInfo.ImageSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Digital signatures count : {documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Barcode signatures count : {documentInfo.BarcodeSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - QrCode signatures count : {documentInfo.QrCodeSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - FormField signatures count : {documentInfo.FormFieldSignatures.Count}");
```

### Step 6: Get Page-Specific Information

Need details about individual pages? You can easily access those too:

```csharp
foreach (PageInfo pageInfo in documentInfo.Pages)
{
   Console.WriteLine($" - page-{pageInfo.PageNumber} Width {pageInfo.Width}, Height {pageInfo.Height}");
}
```

## Real-World Applications

Think about how this functionality could help in your projects:

- Document Management Systems: Automatically catalog and organize documents based on their properties
- Workflow Automation: Trigger different processes based on signature presence or document type
- Compliance Verification: Ensure documents have the required signatures before proceeding with business processes
- Content Indexing: Extract document information for searchable databases

## Conclusion
