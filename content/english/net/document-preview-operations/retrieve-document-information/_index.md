# How to Retrieve Document Information in .NET

## Introduction

Stuck manually checking document properties and signatures? You're definitely not alone. Every developer working with document management systems faces this challenge—extracting document metadata, counting signatures, and gathering file information programmatically can be a real pain without the right tools.

Here's the good news: GroupDocs.Signature for .NET makes retrieving document information incredibly straightforward. Whether you're building a document management system, automating workflows, or just need to extract metadata occasionally, this guide will show you exactly how to get all the document information you need with just a few lines of code.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to extract everything from basic file properties to detailed signature counts, page dimensions, and form field data—all programmatically.

## Why Extract Document Information Programmatically?

Before we dive into the code, let's talk about why this matters. Document information extraction isn't just a nice-to-have feature—it's essential for:

- **Automated Document Processing**: Sort and route documents based on their properties
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure documents meet signature requirements before processing
- **Content Management**: Auto-catalog documents with proper metadata
- **Workflow Optimization**: Trigger different processes based on document characteristics
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify document integrity and completeness

## Prerequisites and Setup

You'll need these basics before we start coding:

1. **GroupDocs.Signature Installation**: Download from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/)
2. **Development Environment**: Any .NET-compatible IDE (Visual Studio recommended)
3. **Test Document**: We'll use "sample_multiple_signatures.docx" in our examples
4. **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with using statements and basic .NET concepts

## Essential Namespace Imports

Let's start by importing the required namespaces—these give us access to all the document information functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```

## Step-by-Step Guide: Extract Document Information

Now for the main event—let's retrieve comprehensive document information step by step.

### Step 1: Define Your Document Path

First, specify where your document lives. This can be a local file path or even a stream:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
```

**Pro tip**: Always use relative paths when possible to make your code more portable across different environments.

### Step 2: Initialize the Signature Object

Create a Signature instance with your document. The `using` statement ensures proper resource disposal:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // All our document processing happens here
}
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Complete Document Information

This single line does all the heavy lifting—it extracts every piece of information available about your document:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
```

What's happening behind the scenes? The API analyzes your document structure, counts all signature types, extracts metadata, and compiles everything into an easily accessible object.

### Step 4: Access Basic Document Properties

Let's display the fundamental document information:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Document properties {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}:");
Console.WriteLine($" - format : {documentInfo.FileType.FileFormat}");
Console.WriteLine($" - extension : {documentInfo.FileType.Extension}");
Console.WriteLine($" - size : {documentInfo.Size}");
Console.WriteLine($" - page count : {documentInfo.PageCount}");
```

This gives you the essentials: file format, extension, size in bytes, and total page count. Perfect for document cataloging systems.

### Step 5: Analyze Signature Data

Here's where things get interesting—you can count every type of signature in your document:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($" - Form Fields count : {documentInfo.FormFields.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Text signatures count : {documentInfo.TextSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Image signatures count : {documentInfo.ImageSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Digital signatures count : {documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - Barcode signatures count : {documentInfo.BarcodeSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - QrCode signatures count : {documentInfo.QrCodeSignatures.Count}");
Console.WriteLine($" - FormField signatures count : {documentInfo.FormFieldSignatures.Count}");
```

This signature analysis is incredibly valuable for compliance workflows—you can automatically verify that documents have the required signatures before processing them further.

### Step 6: Extract Page-Specific Details

Need information about individual pages? You've got it:

```csharp
foreach (PageInfo pageInfo in documentInfo.Pages)
{
   Console.WriteLine($" - page-{pageInfo.PageNumber} Width {pageInfo.Width}, Height {pageInfo.Height}");
}
```

Page dimensions are crucial when you're preparing documents for specific output formats or ensuring they meet certain layout requirements.

## Advanced Use Cases and Applications

Now that you know the basics, let's explore some practical applications where this functionality really shines:

### Document Management Systems

```csharp
// Automatically categorize documents based on signature presence
if (documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count > 0)
{
    // Route to secure processing pipeline
}
else
{
    // Send for signature collection
}
```

### Compliance Verification

```csharp
// Ensure contracts have required signatures
bool isCompliant = documentInfo.DigitalSignatures.Count >= 2 && 
                   documentInfo.TextSignatures.Count >= 1;
```

### Batch Processing Optimization

```csharp
// Skip large documents in certain workflows
if (documentInfo.Size > 10485760) // 10MB
{
    // Handle large files separately
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with straightforward code, you might encounter some challenges. Here's how to handle the most common ones:

### File Access Problems

**Issue**: "Cannot access file" errors
**Solution**: Ensure the file isn't open in another application and check file permissions

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        // Your code here
    }
}
catch (System.UnauthorizedAccessException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Check file permissions and ensure file isn't locked");
}
```

### Unsupported File Formats

**Issue**: Getting null or incomplete information
**Solution**: Verify the file format is supported by GroupDocs.Signature

```csharp
if (documentInfo.FileType.FileFormat == FileFormat.Unknown)
{
    Console.WriteLine("File format not supported or file may be corrupted");
}
```

### Memory Issues with Large Files

**Issue**: Out of memory exceptions with very large documents
**Solution**: Process documents in smaller chunks or increase available memory

## Performance Considerations

When working with document information extraction in production environments, keep these performance tips in mind:

### Optimize for Batch Processing

If you're processing multiple documents, reuse the Signature instance when possible:

```csharp
// Less efficient - creates new instance for each file
foreach (string file in files)
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(file))
    {
        // Process document
    }
}
```

### Cache Results When Appropriate

For documents that don't change frequently, consider caching the document information to avoid repeated API calls.

### Monitor Memory Usage

Large documents or batch processing can consume significant memory. Monitor usage and implement appropriate cleanup strategies.

## Best Practices for Production Use

### Always Use Exception Handling

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        IDocumentInfo documentInfo = signature.GetDocumentInfo();
        // Process information
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log error and handle gracefully
    Console.WriteLine($"Error processing document: {ex.Message}");
}
```

### Validate Input Files

Before processing, check that files exist and are accessible:

```csharp
if (!File.Exists(filePath))
{
    throw new FileNotFoundException($"Document not found: {filePath}");
}
```

### Implement Logging

For production systems, implement comprehensive logging to track document processing:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Processing document: {filePath}");
Console.WriteLine($"Document size: {documentInfo.Size} bytes");
Console.WriteLine($"Processing completed successfully");
```

## When to Use Document Information Extraction

This functionality is particularly valuable in these scenarios:

- **Document Workflow Automation**: Route documents based on properties
- **Compliance Auditing**: Verify signature presence and types
- **Content Management**: Auto-tag and categorize documents
- **Quality Control**: Ensure documents meet specifications before processing
- **Reporting Systems**: Generate document analytics and statistics
