# Generate Document Preview

## Introduction
In today's digital era, where documents are at the heart of communication and transactions, ensuring their integrity and authenticity is paramount. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET empowers developers to seamlessly incorporate document signing capabilities into their .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll delve into generating document previews using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, providing step-by-step guidance for developers.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Installation: Make sure you have GroupDocs.Signature for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. .NET Framework: This tutorial assumes familiarity with .NET Framework and C# programming language.

## Importing Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
    using GroupDocs.Signature;
    using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
The first step involves loading the document for which you want to generate a preview. Replace `"sample.pdf"` with the path to your desired document.
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Define Preview Options
Next, define the options for generating the document preview. Specify the format of the preview and methods for creating and releasing page streams.
```csharp
PreviewOptions previewOption = new PreviewOptions(GeneratePreview.CreatePageStream, GeneratePreview.ReleasePageStream)
{
    PreviewFormat = PreviewOptions.PreviewFormats.JPEG,
};
```
## Step 3: Generate Preview
Utilize the `GeneratePreview()` method to generate the document preview based on the defined options.
```csharp
signature.GeneratePreview(previewOption);
```
## Step 4: Implement CreatePageStream Method
Implement the `CreatePageStream` method to create page streams for preview generation.
```csharp
private static Stream CreatePageStream(int pageNumber)
{
    string imageFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "GeneratePreviewFolder", "image-" + pageNumber.ToString() + ".jpg");
    var folder = Path.GetDirectoryName(imageFilePath);
    if (!Directory.Exists(folder))
    {
        Directory.CreateDirectory(folder);
    }
    return new FileStream(imageFilePath, FileMode.Create);
}
```
## Step 5: Implement ReleasePageStream Method
Implement the `ReleasePageStream` method to release page streams after preview generation.
```csharp
private static void ReleasePageStream(int pageNumber, Stream pageStream)
{
    pageStream.Dispose();
    string imageFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "GeneratePreviewFolder", "image-" + pageNumber.ToString() + ".jpg");
    Console.WriteLine($"Image file {imageFilePath} is ready for preview");
}
```
