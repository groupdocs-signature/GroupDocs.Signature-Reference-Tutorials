## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.
2. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library. You can obtain it from [this link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
3. Document to Sign: Prepare the document(s) you intend to work with. This could be a Word document, PDF, Excel spreadsheet, or any other supported format.

## Import Namespaces
To begin using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Follow these steps:

First, specify the path to the document you want to work with and extract its file name.
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
```
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Instantiate the `Signature` class by passing the file path to the constructor.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Search Document for Image Signatures
Invoke the `Search` method to look for image signatures within the document.
```csharp
List<ImageSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageSignature>(SignatureType.Image);
```
## Step 4: Output Signatures
Iterate through the found image signatures and display their details.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{fileName}'] contains the following image signature(s).");
foreach (ImageSignature imageSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Found Image signature at page {imageSignature.PageNumber} and size {imageSignature.Size}.");
}
```
