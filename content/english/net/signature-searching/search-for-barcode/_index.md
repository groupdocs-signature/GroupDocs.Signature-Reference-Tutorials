## Introduction
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful tool for adding and verifying digital signatures in various document formats using .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll focus on how to search for barcode signatures within a document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Make sure you have downloaded and installed GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a working environment set up for .NET development.
3. Sample Document: Prepare a sample document containing barcode signatures for testing purposes.

## Importing Namespaces
Before you can use GroupDocs.Signature in your code, you need to import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Document Path
First, specify the path to the document containing the barcode signatures:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
```
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Create an instance of the `Signature` class by passing the document path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code for signature search will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Search for Barcode Signatures
Search for barcode signatures within the document:
```csharp
List<BarcodeSignature> signatures = signature.Search<BarcodeSignature>(SignatureType.Barcode);
```
## Step 4: Display Results
Iterate through the found barcode signatures and display their details:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains the following signatures.");
foreach (var barcodeSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Barcode signature found at page {barcodeSignature.PageNumber} with type {barcodeSignature.EncodeType.TypeName} and text {barcodeSignature.Text}");
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to search for barcode signatures within a document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and utilizing the provided code examples, you can efficiently integrate signature searching functionality into your .NET applications.
