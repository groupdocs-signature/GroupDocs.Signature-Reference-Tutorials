## Introduction
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful tool for developers to add signature functionality to their .NET applications. Whether you're building a document management system, a contract signing platform, or any other application that requires signature handling, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET provides the features you need to integrate signature functionality seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your development machine.
2. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
3. Access to Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the documentation available at [GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Documentation](https://tutorials.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
4. Access to Support: In case of any issues or queries, access the support forum at [GroupDocs.Signature Forum](https://forum.groupdocs.com/c/signature/13).

## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET in your project, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
#Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define File Path
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf"_SIGNED_FORMFIELD;
```
In this step, you define the file path of the document you want to work with. Replace `"sample.pdf"` with the path to your desired PDF file.
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your code here
}
```
Here, you initialize a new instance of the `Signature` class, passing the file path of the document as a parameter. This sets up the context for working with signatures in the document.
## Step 3: Search for Form Fields
```csharp
List<FormFieldSignature> signatures = signature.Search<FormFieldSignature>(SignatureType.FormField);
```
In this step, you use the `Search` method of the `Signature` object to find form field signatures within the document. The method returns a list of `FormFieldSignature` objects representing the form fields found.
## Step 4: Iterate and Display Signatures
```csharp
foreach (var FormFieldSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"FormField signature found. Name : {FormFieldSignature.Name}. Value: {FormFieldSignature.Value}");
}
```
Finally, you iterate through the list of form field signatures and display information about each signature, such as its name and value.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers a comprehensive solution for integrating signature functionality into your .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily search for form fields within your documents and manipulate them as needed.
