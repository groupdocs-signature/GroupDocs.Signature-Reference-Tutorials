## Introduction
In the realm of document management and authentication, the ability to efficiently search for text signatures within digital documents is paramount. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers a powerful solution to this need, providing developers with a comprehensive toolkit for locating text signatures within various file formats. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of searching for text signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, breaking down each step to ensure a clear understanding of the implementation.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library from the [releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
3. Sample Document: Prepare a sample document containing text signatures for testing purposes.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is required to follow along with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
To initiate the process, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
```
In this step, we specify the file path of the sample document containing text signatures and initialize a new instance of the `Signature` class.
## Step 2: Configure Search Options
```csharp
    TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions()
    {
        AllPages = true, // this value is set by default
    };
```
Here, we configure the search options for text signatures. In this example, we set `AllPages` property to `true` to search across all pages of the document.
## Step 3: Perform Text Signature Search
```csharp
    List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);
```
This step executes the search operation using the specified options and retrieves a list of `TextSignature` objects containing the found text signatures.
## Step 4: Output Results
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{fileName}'] contains following text signature(s).");
    foreach (TextSignature textSignature in signatures)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found Text signature at page {textSignature.PageNumber} with type [{textSignature.SignatureImplementation}] and text '{textSignature.Text}'.");
    }
}
```
Finally, we display the results of the text signature search, iterating through each found signature and outputting its page number, signature type, and text content.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the process of searching for text signatures within digital documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and leveraging the provided code examples, developers can efficiently integrate text signature search functionality into their .NET applications, enhancing document management and authentication capabilities.
