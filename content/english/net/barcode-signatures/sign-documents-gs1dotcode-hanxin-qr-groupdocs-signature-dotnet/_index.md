Ready to enhance your document workflows? Let's dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
### Required Libraries
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: This library allows you to sign various types of documents using different barcode and QR code formats.
### Environment Setup Requirements
- Work with a compatible .NET environment (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework 4.7.2+).
- Have Visual Studio installed if you are working on a desktop application.
### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET development.
- Familiarity with using NuGet packages for dependency management.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
To get started, install the GroupDocs.Signature library:
**Using .NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```
**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```
**NuGet Package Manager UI**: 
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.
### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial to test features.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Buy a full license if you're ready to deploy in production.
#### Basic Initialization
To initialize GroupDocs.Signature, create an instance of the `Signature` class with your document path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("your-document-path"))
{
    // Your signing code here
}
```
## Implementation Guide
Let's break down how to implement each feature step-by-step.
### Sign Document with GS1DotCode Barcode
**Overview**: Add GS1DotCode barcodes to your documents, a popular choice for supply chain and inventory management.
#### Step 1: Initialize Signature Object
Create an instance of `Signature` using the source file path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
#### Step 2: Configure GS1DotCode Options
Set up your barcode options, including content, format, and dimensions.
```csharp
var gs1DotCodeOptions = new BarcodeSignOptions(
    "(01)04912345123459(15)970331(30)128(10)ABC123", 
    BarcodeTypes.GS1DotCode)
{
    Left = 1,
    Top = 1,
    Height = 150,
    Width = 200,
    ReturnContent = true, // Retrieve the signed image's content
    ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG // Output as PNG
};
```
#### Step 3: Sign and Save Document
Execute the signing process and save the result to a specified path.
```csharp
var signResult = signature.Sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AdvancedBarCodeTypes.pptx", gs1DotCodeOptions);
```
### Sign Document with HanXin QR Code
**Overview**: Embed HanXin QR codes in your documents, widely used for secure data sharing.
#### Step 1: Initialize Signature Object
Similar to the barcode setup, initialize `Signature`:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
#### Step 2: Configure HanXin QR Options
Define your QR code options with content and appearance settings.
```csharp
var hanXinOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions(
    "(01)04912345123459(15)970331(30)128(10)ABC123", 
    QrCodeTypes.HanXin)
{
    Left = 201,
    Top = 1,
    Height = 200,
    Width = 200,
    ReturnContent = true, // Retrieve the signed image's content
    ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG // Output as PNG
};
```
#### Step 3: Sign and Save Document
Proceed to sign and store your document.
```csharp
var signResult = signature.Sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AdvancedQRCodeTypes.pptx", hanXinOptions);
```
### List Newly Created Signatures
**Overview**: Verify the signatures added by listing them post-signing.
#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Initialize Signature Object**: Just like previous features.
2. **List and Output Signatures**: Use a method to iterate through signed items.
```csharp
void ListNewSignatures(SignResult signResult)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nList of newly created signatures:");
    int number = 1;
    foreach (var item in signResult.Succeeded)
    {
        switch (item)
        {
            case BarcodeSignature barcodeSignature:
                string barOutputImagePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", $"image{number}{barcodeSignature.Format.Extension}");
                using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(barOutputImagePath, FileMode.Create))
                {
                    fs.Write(barcodeSignature.Content, 0, barcodeSignature.Content.Length);
                }
                number++;
                break;
            case QrCodeSignature qrCodeSignature:
                string qrOutputImagePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", $"image{number}{qrCodeSignature.Format.Extension}");
                using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(qrOutputImagePath, FileMode.Create))
                {
                    fs.Write(qrCodeSignature.Content, 0, qrCodeSignature.Content.Length);
                }
                number++;
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
## Practical Applications
- **Supply Chain Management**: Use GS1DotCode to track products from manufacturing to retail.
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Implement HanXin QR codes for encrypted information sharing in business documents.
