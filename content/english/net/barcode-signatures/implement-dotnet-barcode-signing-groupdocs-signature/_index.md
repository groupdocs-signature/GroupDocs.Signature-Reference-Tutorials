- Practical applications of these features in real-world scenarios

Ready to dive into the world of secure document signing? Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have:
- **.NET Framework** or .NET Core installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming.
- Visual Studio or any preferred IDE that supports .NET development.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
To integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your project, follow these steps:

#### Installation Information
Choose one method to add the package:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial to test GroupDocs.Signature's capabilities. For extended use, consider obtaining a temporary or purchased license:
- **Free Trial**: [Download here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/)
- **Temporary License**: [Get your temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)
- **Purchase**: [Buy a license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy)

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the `Signature` class with the path to your document:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using System.IO;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.pdf";
var signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's delve into implementing barcode signatures using different types.

### GS1CompositeBar Barcode Signing
#### Overview
The GS1CompositeBar is ideal for supply chain documents requiring detailed information. It supports complex data structures like GTINs and batch numbers.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**3.1 Setting Up the Signature Options**
Create `BarcodeSignOptions` with necessary parameters:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
var bc_GS1CompositeBar = new BarcodeSignOptions("(01)03212345678906|(21)A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8", BarcodeTypes.GS1CompositeBar)
{
    Top = 100, // Vertical position
    ReturnContent = true,
    ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
};
```
**3.2 Signing the Document**
Use the `Sign` method to embed the barcode:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithBarcodeTypes", "Sample_Signed.pdf");
    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, bc_GS1CompositeBar);
}
```

### HIBCCode39LIC Barcode Signing
#### Overview
HIBCCode39LIC barcodes are suitable for healthcare documents, offering a balance of data capacity and readability.

**3.3 Setting Up the Signature Options**
```csharp
var bc_HIBCLICCode39 = new BarcodeSignOptions("+A99912345/$$52001510X3", BarcodeTypes.HIBCCode39LIC)
{
    Top = 300, // Vertical position
    ReturnContent = true,
    ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
};
```
**3.4 Signing the Document**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithBarcodeTypes", "Sample_Signed.pdf");
    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, bc_HIBCLICCode39);
}
```

### HIBCCode128LIC Barcode Signing
#### Overview
HIBCCode128LIC barcodes are versatile and can store more information compared to Code 39.

**3.5 Setting Up the Signature Options**
```csharp
var bc_HIBCLICCode128 = new BarcodeSignOptions("+A99912345/$$52001510X3", BarcodeTypes.HIBCCode128LIC)
{
    Top = 500, // Vertical position
    ReturnContent = true,
    ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
};
```
**3.6 Signing the Document**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithBarcodeTypes", "Sample_Signed.pdf");
    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, bc_HIBCLICCode128);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the document path is correct.
- Verify that your project references GroupDocs.Signature correctly.
- Check for exceptions in signing process and handle them appropriately.

## Practical Applications
Barcode signing with GroupDocs.Signature can be applied in various scenarios:
1. **Supply Chain Management**: Use GS1 barcodes to track products through different stages.
2. **Healthcare Document Handling**: Implement HIBC codes on patient records for efficient tracking.
3. **Contract Signing**: Add barcode signatures to legal documents to ensure authenticity.

Integration with other systems, like ERP or CRM solutions, can further enhance document management workflows.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize performance by minimizing I/O operations and managing resources efficiently.
- Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
- Follow .NET best practices for memory management, such as disposing of objects when no longer needed.

## Conclusion
You've now learned how to implement barcode signing in your .NET applications using GroupDocs.Signature. Experiment with different barcode types and explore their applications in your projects. For further exploration, consider integrating additional GroupDocs features or delving deeper into document security measures.
