## Implementation Guide

Now let's dive into implementing each feature with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

### Sign Document with Image Signature

This section demonstrates how to add an image signature to your document.

#### Overview
Adding an image signature involves specifying the image and its properties like alignment, size, and margin.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Set Up Your File Paths**
   Define paths for your input document and output file:
   ```csharp
   string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.docx";
   string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedDocument.docx");
   ```
2. **Initialize Signature Object**
   Use the `Signature` class to load your document:
   ```csharp
   using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
   {
       ImageSignOptions signOptions = new ImageSignOptions("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\image.png")
       {
           VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top,
           HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
           Width = 100,
           Height = 40,
           Margin = new Padding(20)
       };

       SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, signOptions);
   }
   ```
3. **Configure Signature Options**
   Customize the appearance and placement of your image signature using `ImageSignOptions`.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct.
- Check that your image file is accessible.

### Search Document for Image Signature

This feature allows you to locate existing image signatures within a document.

#### Overview
Searching for image signatures helps verify which parts of the document are signed.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Load Signed Document**
   Use the `Signature` class to open your signed document:
   ```csharp
   using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
   {
       ImageSearchOptions searchOptions = new ImageSearchOptions() { AllPages = true };
       List<ImageSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageSignature>(searchOptions);
   }
   ```
2. **Configure Search Options**
   Set `AllPages` to `true` if you want to search the entire document.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document is correctly signed before searching.
- Verify that all pages are included in the search scope.

### Update Document Image Signature

This feature lets you modify the position and size of existing image signatures.

#### Overview
Updating an image signature might be necessary for aesthetic adjustments or corrections.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Search and Collect Signatures**
   Retrieve the signatures to update:
   ```csharp
   List<ImageSignature> signaturesToUpdate = new List<ImageSignature>();
   foreach (ImageSignature imageSignature in signatures)
   {
       imageSignature.Left += 100;
       imageSignature.Top += 100;
       imageSignature.Width = 200;
       imageSignature.Height = 50;
   }
   ```
2. **Update Signatures**
   Apply the updates to your document:
   ```csharp
   using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
   {
       List<BaseSignature> baseSignaturesToUpdate = signatures.ConvertAll(p => (BaseSignature)p);
       UpdateResult updateResult = signature.Update(baseSignaturesToUpdate);
   }
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Double-check the updated coordinates and dimensions.
- Ensure you have a backup of your original document.

### Delete Document Image Signature by ID

This feature allows you to remove image signatures using their unique IDs.

#### Overview
Deleting unwanted signatures helps maintain document integrity.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Identify Signatures to Delete**
   Collect the signature IDs:
   ```csharp
   List<string> signatureIds = new List<string>();
   foreach (var item in signatureIds)
   {
       ImageSignature temp = new ImageSignature(item);
       signaturesToDelete.Add(temp);
   }
   ```
2. **Delete the Signatures**
   Remove them from your document:
   ```csharp
   using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
   {
       DeleteResult deleteResult = signature.Delete(signaturesToDelete);
   }
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify the IDs of signatures you intend to delete.
- Make sure to handle exceptions for cases where a signature might not exist.
