## Adding Your First Image Signature - Step by Step

Let's start with the most common scenario: adding an image signature to a document. This is perfect for company logos, stamps, or watermarks.

### Understanding Image Signature Basics

When you add an image signature, you're essentially:
1. Loading your document into memory
2. Specifying where the image should be placed
3. Configuring how it should look (size, alignment, etc.)
4. Saving the signed document

Here's how it works in practice:

### Complete Code Example

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.docx";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedDocument.docx");
```

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    ImageSignOptions signOptions = new ImageSignOptions("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\image.png")
    {
        VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top,
        HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
        Width = 100,
        Height = 40,
        Margin = new Padding(20)
    };

    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, signOptions);
}
```

### Breaking Down the Configuration Options

Let's understand what each property does:

**VerticalAlignment**: Controls where your signature appears vertically
- `Top`: Perfect for letterheads
- `Bottom`: Great for approval stamps
- `Center`: Good for watermarks

**HorizontalAlignment**: Controls horizontal positioning
- `Left`: Standard for most signatures
- `Center`: Ideal for logos and watermarks
- `Right`: Common for approval stamps

**Width/Height**: Signature dimensions in pixels
- Keep proportions realistic (company logos typically work well at 100x40 pixels)
- Too large signatures can overwhelm document content

**Margin**: Space around your signature (prevents overlap with text)

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "File not found" errors
**Solution**: Always use absolute paths or check your working directory:
```csharp
string fullPath = Path.GetFullPath("sample.docx");
Console.WriteLine($"Looking for file at: {fullPath}");
```

**Problem**: Image appears too large or too small
**Solution**: Calculate proportional dimensions:
```csharp
// For a 200x50 logo, maintain aspect ratio
int desiredWidth = 100;
int proportionalHeight = (50 * desiredWidth) / 200; // Result: 25
```

**Problem**: Signature overlaps with text
**Solution**: Increase margin values:
```csharp
Margin = new Padding(top: 30, right: 20, bottom: 30, left: 20)
```

## Searching for Image Signatures in Documents

Once you've signed documents, you'll often need to verify what signatures exist. This is crucial for document validation workflows.

### When You'd Use Signature Search

Here are real-world scenarios where signature searching is essential:
- **Audit trails**: Verify who signed what and when
- **Document validation**: Ensure required signatures are present
- **Batch processing**: Find all unsigned documents in a folder
- **Compliance checks**: Confirm signature placement meets requirements

### Complete Search Implementation

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    ImageSearchOptions searchOptions = new ImageSearchOptions() { AllPages = true };
    List<ImageSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageSignature>(searchOptions);
}
```

### Understanding Search Results

The search returns a `List<ImageSignature>` with detailed information about each signature:

```csharp
foreach (ImageSignature imageSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Signature found at: {imageSignature.Left}, {imageSignature.Top}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Signature size: {imageSignature.Width}x{imageSignature.Height}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Signature ID: {imageSignature.SignatureId}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Page number: {imageSignature.PageNumber}");
}
```

### Pro Tips for Effective Searching

**Search Specific Pages**: If you know signatures are only on certain pages:
```csharp
ImageSearchOptions searchOptions = new ImageSearchOptions() 
{ 
    AllPages = false,
    PageNumber = 1 // Search only the first page
};
```

**Performance Optimization**: For large documents, avoid searching all pages unless necessary:
```csharp
// Search only first 3 pages
ImageSearchOptions searchOptions = new ImageSearchOptions()
{
    PagesSetup = new PagesSetup() { FirstPage = 1, LastPage = 3 }
};
```

### Troubleshooting Search Issues

**Issue**: Search returns empty results even though signatures exist
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're searching the correct document (the signed version, not the original)
2. Verify the signature was added as an image signature (not text or digital signature)
3. Check if signatures are on pages you're actually searching

## Updating Image Signature Properties

Sometimes you need to adjust existing signatures - maybe they're in the wrong position or need resizing. GroupDocs.Signature makes this easy.

### When to Update Signatures

**Common scenarios**:
- **Template adjustments**: Moving signatures to comply with new document templates
- **Batch corrections**: Fixing positioning issues across multiple documents  
- **Responsive adjustments**: Resizing signatures for different document formats
- **Quality improvements**: Upgrading to higher resolution signature images

### Step-by-Step Update Process

First, you need to find the signatures to update:

```csharp
List<ImageSignature> signaturesToUpdate = new List<ImageSignature>();
foreach (ImageSignature imageSignature in signatures)
{
    imageSignature.Left += 100;
    imageSignature.Top += 100;
    imageSignature.Width = 200;
    imageSignature.Height = 50;
}
```

Then apply the updates:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    List<BaseSignature> baseSignaturesToUpdate = signatures.ConvertAll(p => (BaseSignature)p);
    UpdateResult updateResult = signature.Update(baseSignaturesToUpdate);
}
```

### Understanding Update Operations

**Position Updates**: Moving signatures is straightforward:
- `Left`: Horizontal position in pixels from the left edge
- `Top`: Vertical position in pixels from the top edge

**Size Updates**: Resizing maintains image quality:
- `Width`/`Height`: New dimensions in pixels
- Always maintain aspect ratio to avoid distortion

### Best Practices for Updates

**1. Always Backup First**
```csharp
// Create a backup before updating
string backupPath = outputFilePath.Replace(".docx", "_backup.docx");
File.Copy(outputFilePath, backupPath);
```

**2. Validate New Positions**
```csharp
// Ensure signatures don't go off-page
if (imageSignature.Left + imageSignature.Width > pageWidth)
{
    imageSignature.Left = pageWidth - imageSignature.Width - 10; // 10px margin
}
```

**3. Batch Updates for Efficiency**
```csharp
// Update multiple signatures in one operation
List<BaseSignature> batchUpdates = new List<BaseSignature>();
foreach (var sig in foundSignatures)
{
    // Apply your changes
    sig.Left += 50;
    batchUpdates.Add(sig);
}
signature.Update(batchUpdates); // Single API call
```

## Removing Unwanted Image Signatures

Eventually, you'll need to remove signatures - whether they're outdated, incorrectly placed, or no longer needed.

### Why Delete Signatures?

**Common reasons**:
- **Document revisions**: Removing outdated approval stamps
- **Template cleanup**: Clearing placeholder signatures  
- **Error correction**: Removing incorrectly placed signatures
- **Workflow changes**: Updating documents for new processes

### Deletion by Signature ID

```csharp
List<string> signatureIds = new List<string>();
foreach (var item in signatureIds)
{
    ImageSignature temp = new ImageSignature(item);
    signaturesToDelete.Add(temp);
}
```

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    DeleteResult deleteResult = signature.Delete(signaturesToDelete);
}
```

### Safe Deletion Practices

**1. Verify Before Deleting**
```csharp
// Double-check which signatures you're deleting
foreach (var sig in signaturesToDelete)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"About to delete signature at {sig.Left}, {sig.Top}");
    // Add confirmation logic here if needed
}
```

**2. Handle Deletion Errors**
```csharp
try
{
    DeleteResult result = signature.Delete(signaturesToDelete);
    if (result.Succeeded.Count != signaturesToDelete.Count)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Some signatures could not be deleted:");
        foreach (var failed in result.Failed)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Failed: {failed.Error}");
        }
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Deletion failed: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

Let's explore how businesses actually use GroupDocs.Signature for image signatures:

### 1. Automated Contract Management
**Scenario**: A legal firm needs to add company stamps to hundreds of contracts daily.

```csharp
// Batch process all contracts in a folder
string[] contracts = Directory.GetFiles("contracts", "*.pdf");
foreach (string contract in contracts)
{
    // Add law firm stamp to each contract
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(contract))
    {
        ImageSignOptions options = new ImageSignOptions("lawfirm-stamp.png")
        {
            VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Bottom,
            HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right,
            Margin = new Padding(20)
        };
        signature.Sign(contract.Replace(".pdf", "_stamped.pdf"), options);
    }
}
```

### 2. Document Approval Workflows  
**Scenario**: HR department needs to track document approvals with manager signatures.

```csharp
// Add approval signature with timestamp
ImageSignOptions approvalOptions = new ImageSignOptions("manager-signature.png")
{
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Bottom,
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
    // Add text alongside image signature
    Text = $"Approved by Manager - {DateTime.Now:MM/dd/yyyy}"
};
```

### 3. Watermarking Sensitive Documents
**Scenario**: Financial institution needs to watermark all customer statements.

```csharp
// Add "CONFIDENTIAL" watermark across document
ImageSignOptions watermarkOptions = new ImageSignOptions("confidential-watermark.png")
{
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    Transparency = 0.3, // Semi-transparent
    Width = 400,
    Height = 100
};
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

When working with GroupDocs.Signature in production, consider these performance optimizations:

### Memory Management
```csharp
// Use 'using' statements to ensure proper disposal
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your signature operations here
} // Automatically disposed here
```

### Batch Processing Efficiency
```csharp
// Process multiple operations in a single session
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Add multiple signatures at once
    List<SignOptions> allSignatures = new List<SignOptions>
    {
        new ImageSignOptions("logo.png") { /* options */ },
        new ImageSignOptions("stamp.png") { /* options */ }
    };
    
    signature.Sign(outputPath, allSignatures);
}
```

### Asynchronous Processing
For web applications, consider async operations:
```csharp
public async Task<string> SignDocumentAsync(string inputPath, string imagePath)
{
    return await Task.Run(() =>
    {
        using (Signature signature = new Signature(inputPath))
        {
            // Your signing logic
            return outputPath;
        }
    });
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. File Access Issues
**Problem**: "File is being used by another process"
**Solution**: Always dispose of Signature objects properly and avoid keeping files open in other applications.

### 2. Path-Related Errors  
**Problem**: Files not found or access denied
**Solution**: Use absolute paths and check file permissions:
```csharp
string absolutePath = Path.GetFullPath(relativePath);
if (!File.Exists(absolutePath))
{
    throw new FileNotFoundException($"Document not found: {absolutePath}");
}
```

### 3. Image Quality Issues
**Problem**: Signatures appear blurry or pixelated
**Solution**: Use high-resolution images and appropriate sizing:
```csharp
// For 300 DPI documents, use images at least 300x75 pixels for a 1"x0.25" signature
ImageSignOptions options = new ImageSignOptions("high-res-signature.png")
{
    Width = 300,  // 1 inch at 300 DPI
    Height = 75   // 0.25 inch at 300 DPI
};
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom Positioning with Coordinates
```csharp
ImageSignOptions preciseOptions = new ImageSignOptions("signature.png")
{
    // Position at exact coordinates (in points, not pixels)
    Left = 72,    // 1 inch from left (72 points = 1 inch)
    Top = 144,    // 2 inches from top
    LocationMeasureType = MeasureType.Points
};
```

### Multi-Page Signature Placement
```csharp
ImageSignOptions multiPageOptions = new ImageSignOptions("watermark.png")
{
    AllPages = true, // Apply to all pages
    // Or specify exact pages:
    PagesSetup = new PagesSetup 
    { 
        FirstPage = 1, 
        LastPage = 5, 
        OddPages = true // Only odd pages
    }
};
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Quick Diagnostic Checklist

When things aren't working as expected, check these common issues:

**âœ“ File permissions**: Can your application read/write the document files?
**âœ“ License status**: Is your GroupDocs license valid and properly configured?
**âœ“ Image format**: Are you using supported image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP)?
**âœ“ Document format**: Is the document format supported for image signatures?
**âœ“ Path accuracy**: Are all file paths correct and accessible?

### Error Code Reference

**Common exceptions you might encounter**:

- `FileNotFoundException`: Double-check file paths
