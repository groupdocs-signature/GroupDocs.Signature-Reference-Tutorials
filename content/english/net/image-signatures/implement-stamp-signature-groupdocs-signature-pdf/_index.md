# How to Implement Stamp Signatures on PDFs Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

In the digital age, securing document authenticity and integrity is paramount. Whether you're a business or an individual needing to apply stamp signatures to important documents without manual printing, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET simplifies this task seamlessly. This tutorial will guide you through adding custom stamp signatures to PDF files using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up and installing GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Creating customizable stamp signatures
- Programmatically signing your PDF documents
- Integrating GroupDocs.Signature into existing .NET applications

Let's begin by covering the prerequisites first.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core** installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET project structure.
- Visual Studio or another IDE for developing .NET applications.

You'll also need to install the GroupDocs.Signature library. Here's how you can do it using different package managers.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

### Installation

To integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your .NET project, choose one of these methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version directly from the interface.

### License Acquisition

Start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs.Signature's features. Acquire a temporary license to remove evaluation limitations and access full functionality.

### Initialization

After installation, initialize your project by adding necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement stamp signing for a PDF document step-by-step.

### Feature: Stamp Signature on a Document

This section demonstrates applying a stamp signature using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

Start by specifying your input and output file paths. Replace `@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the path to your source PDF and `@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` where you want to save the signed document.
```csharp
string filePath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithStamp", fileName);
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Signature Object

Create an instance of the `Signature` class to handle signing operations:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Signing code will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Stamp Sign Options

Set up your stamp's properties using `StampSignOptions`. This includes the position, size, and appearance of the stamp.
```csharp
StampSignOptions options = new StampSignOptions()
{
    Left = 50,
    Top = 150,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 200
};
```

#### Step 4: Define Stamp Lines

Define the visual elements of your stamp, such as text lines and colors. This example creates an outer line and an inner line:
```csharp
// Outer line configuration
StampLine outerLine = new StampLine()
{
    Text = " * European Union ",
    TextRepeatType = StampTextRepeatType.FullTextRepeat,
    Font = { Size = 12 },
    Height = 22,
    TextBottomIntent = 6,
    TextColor = Color.WhiteSmoke,
    BackgroundColor = Color.DarkSlateBlue
};
options.OuterLines.Add(outerLine);

// Inner line configuration
StampLine innerLine = new StampLine()
{
    Text = "John Smith",
    TextColor = Color.MediumVioletRed,
    Font = { Size = 20, Bold = true },
    Height = 40
};
options.InnerLines.Add(innerLine);
```

#### Step 5: Sign the Document

Finally, apply your stamp signature to the document and save it:
```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

## Practical Applications

Here are real-world scenarios where this feature is useful:
1. **Contract Management**: Automatically sign contracts with a company stamp before sending.
2. **Invoice Processing**: Stamp invoices with approval signatures for faster processing.
3. **Legal Documents**: Apply official stamps to legal documents, ensuring they're ready for submission or archiving.
4. **Educational Certifications**: Generate stamped certificates for students and professionals.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Signature in .NET applications, consider these tips:
- Optimize resource usage by managing memory effectively, especially when processing large PDF files.
- Use asynchronous programming to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.
- Monitor performance and adjust configurations like buffer sizes and threading as necessary.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to implement a stamp signature in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. By following these steps, you can automate document signing processes, enhancing both efficiency and security in your applications.
