- How to set up the GroupDocs.Signature library for .NET.
- A step-by-step guide on deleting QR code signatures from documents.
- Practical applications and integration possibilities.
- Tips for optimizing performance when using GroupDocs.Signature.

Let's get started by understanding some prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher installed.
- A compatible IDE like Visual Studio.

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your development environment is set up to compile C# code. You'll also need access to GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with:
- Basic C# programming.
- File operations in .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Installing the GroupDocs.Signature library is straightforward. Here's how you can install it using different package managers:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial:** Download from [GroupDocs Free Trial](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
- **Temporary License:** Apply on [GroupDocs Temporary License page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase:** Buy a license for unlimited use at [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Signature, create an instance of the `Signature` class with your document's path.

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("your-file-path"))
{
    // Your code to work with signatures here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Deleting QR Code Signatures by Type

#### Overview
This section focuses on deleting QR Code signatures from a document, maintaining its integrity and confidentiality.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Set up the file paths for your source and output files:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output_" + fileName);
```

#### Step 2: Load Document
Load the document using GroupDocs.Signature:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code for further operations.
}
```

#### Step 3: Search for QR Code Signatures
Use the `Search` method to find all signatures of type QR-Code:

```csharp
var searchOptions = new BarcodeSearchOptions()
{
    AllText = true,
    BarcodeType = BarcodeTypes.QR,
};

// Search for QR code signatures in the document.
List<Signature> qrSignatures = signature.Search(searchOptions);
```

#### Step 4: Delete Found Signatures
Iterate over found QR codes and delete them:

```csharp
foreach (var qrCodeSignature in qrSignatures)
{
    // Check if the signature is of type QR-Code
    if (qrCodeSignature.SignatureType == SignatureTypeEnum.Barcode && 
        qrCodeSignature.EncodeType == BarcodeTypes.QR)
    {
        // Delete the signature from the document.
        signature.Delete(qrCodeSignature);
    }
}

// Save the modified document to output path
signature.Save(outputFilePath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Access Issues:** Ensure proper permissions for reading and writing files.
- **Signature Not Found:** Verify that the file contains QR codes.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Management Systems:**
   Automate signature cleanup in corporate environments to ensure compliance with document retention policies.
2. **Legal Document Processing:**
   Remove outdated signatures from legal documents for new revisions or agreements.
3. **E-commerce Platforms:**
   Manage order confirmations by removing expired QR-code signatures to maintain clarity and prevent confusion.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimizing Performance
- Use `using` statements for efficient resource management.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks when handling large documents.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Ensure your system has adequate memory for processing large files.
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Signature for performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management with GroupDocs.Signature
- Dispose of `Signature` objects promptly after use to free up resources.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent resource leaks.
