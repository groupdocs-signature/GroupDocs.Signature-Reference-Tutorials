### Basic Initialization and Setup

After installation, you can initialize GroupDocs.Signature as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize Signature object with file path
Signature signature = new Signature("path/to/your/document");
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we’ll walk through the steps to delete specific types of signatures from a document.

### Deleting Specific Signatures by Type

#### Overview
This feature allows you to remove particular signature types such as text, image, barcode, QR code, and digital from your documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Set Up Directory Paths**
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample_Signed_Multi");
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(sourceFilePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "DeleteBySignatureTypes", fileName);

if (!Directory.Exists(Path.GetDirectoryName(outputFilePath)))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(outputFilePath));
}
File.Copy(sourceFilePath, outputFilePath, true);
```

**2. Compose the List of Signature Types to Delete**
```csharp
var signedTypes = new List<SignatureType>
{
    SignatureType.Text,
    SignatureType.Image,
    SignatureType.Barcode,
    SignatureType.QrCode,
    SignatureType.Digital
};
```

**3. Execute Deletion of Specific Signature Types**
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Delete specified signatures by types
    DeleteResult result = signature.Delete(signedTypes);

    if (result.Succeeded.Count > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Following signatures were removed:");
        int number = 1;
        foreach (BaseSignature temp in result.Succeeded)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Signature #{number++}: Type: {temp.SignatureType} Id:{temp.SignatureId}. Created: {temp.CreatedOn.ToShortDateString()}");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("No signatures were deleted.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Key Parts:**
- **DeleteResult**: This object holds information about the deletion process, indicating success or failure.
- **signature.Delete(signedTypes)**: Deletes signatures from the specified types in your document.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that the file paths are correctly set and accessible.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Signature library is properly installed and referenced in your project.
- If no signatures are deleted, check if the document contains the signature types you're targeting.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be applied in various real-world scenarios:

1. **Legal Document Management**: Remove outdated or incorrect signatures from contracts.
2. **Contract Renewal**: Update contract versions by deleting old signatures and adding new ones.
3. **Document Verification Systems**: Integrate with systems that require signature validation before processing documents.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of objects once they are no longer needed.
- Use efficient file handling practices to minimize I/O operations.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks and address them accordingly.
