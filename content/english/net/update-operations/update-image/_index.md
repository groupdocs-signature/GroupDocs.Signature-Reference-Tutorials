```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory where you want to save the updated document.
## Step 3: Copy Source File
```csharp
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```

using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
```
Create an instance of the `Signature` class, passing the output file path as a parameter.
## Step 5: Search for Image Signatures

ImageSearchOptions options = new ImageSearchOptions();
List<ImageSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageSignature>(options);
```
Utilize the `Search` method to look for image signatures within the document.
## Step 6: Update Image Signature Properties
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    ImageSignature imageSignature = signatures[0];
    imageSignature.Left = 200;
    imageSignature.Top = 250;
    imageSignature.Width = 200;
    imageSignature.Height = 200;
}
```
Modify the properties of the image signature according to your requirements, such as position and size.
## Step 7: Perform Update
```csharp
bool result = signature.Update(imageSignature);
```
Invoke the `Update` method to apply the changes to the image signature.
## Step 8: Handle Result
```csharp
if (result)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Image signature at location {imageSignature.Left}x{imageSignature.Top} and Size {imageSignature.Size}' was updated in the document ['{fileName}'].");
}
else
{
    Helper.WriteError($"Signature was not updated in the document! Signature at location {imageSignature.Left}x{imageSignature.Top} and Size {imageSignature.Size} was not found!");
}
```
Check the result of the update operation and handle accordingly.
