## Introduction
In today's digital world, the ability to securely sign documents electronically has become essential for businesses and individuals alike. Whether it's contracts, agreements, or forms, electronic signatures streamline the signing process, saving time and resources. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful tool that enables developers to integrate robust electronic signature functionality into their .NET applications effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to update QR codes within documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, taking you through each step with clarity and precision.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a .NET development environment set up on your machine.
3. Sample Document: Prepare a sample document containing QR codes that you wish to update. Ensure it's accessible within your project directory.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start updating QR codes, let's import the necessary namespaces to our project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's dive into updating QR codes within documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET:
## Step 1: Copy the Source Document
Firstly, copy the source document to a new location since the `Update` method works with the same document.
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UpdateQRCode", fileName);
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Instance
Initialize a `Signature` instance to work with the document.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Signature operations will be performed here
}
```
## Step 3: Search for QR Code Signatures
Search for QR code signatures within the document.
```csharp
QrCodeSearchOptions options = new QrCodeSearchOptions();
List<QrCodeSignature> signatures = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(options);
```
## Step 4: Update QR Code Position and Size
If QR code signatures are found, update their position and size as required.
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    QrCodeSignature qrCodeSignature = signatures[0];
    qrCodeSignature.Left = 200;
    qrCodeSignature.Top = 250;
    qrCodeSignature.Width = 200;
    qrCodeSignature.Height = 200;
}
```
## Step 5: Perform the Update Operation
Finally, perform the update operation on the QR code signature.
```csharp
bool result = signature.Update(qrCodeSignature);
if (result)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"QR Code signature was successfully updated in the document.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Failed to update QR Code signature in the document.");
}
```
