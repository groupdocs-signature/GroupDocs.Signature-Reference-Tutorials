# Update Barcode

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to update a barcode signature within a document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with digital signatures, including various types like barcode, text, image, and more. We'll go through the process step by step to ensure you understand each part thoroughly.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- GroupDocs.Signature for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
- A sample document containing the barcode signature you want to update.
## Import Namespaces
First, we need to import the necessary namespaces into our C# code. These namespaces provide the required classes and methods to work with digital signatures.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
Now, let's break down the code example into multiple steps and explain each step in detail:
## Step 1: Define File Paths
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UpdateBarcode", Path.GetFileName(filePath));
```
Here, `filePath` represents the path to the input document containing the barcode signature, and `outputFilePath` is the path where the updated document will be saved.
## Step 2: Copy the Source File
```csharp
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```
This step copies the source file to the output directory to ensure that the `Update` method works with the same document.
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Instance
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Code snippet goes here...
}
```
We initialize a `Signature` instance using the output file path, which allows us to work with the document's signatures.
## Step 4: Search for Barcode Signatures
```csharp
BarcodeSearchOptions options = new BarcodeSearchOptions()
{
    Text = "12345",
    MatchType = TextMatchType.Contains
};
List<BarcodeSignature> signatures = signature.Search<BarcodeSignature>(options);
```
Here, we create `BarcodeSearchOptions` with the text to search for within barcode signatures. We then use the `Search` method to find all barcode signatures matching the specified criteria.
## Step 5: Update Barcode Signature
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    BarcodeSignature barcodeSignature = signatures[0];
    // Code snippet goes here...
}
```
If barcode signatures are found, we proceed to update the first one found.
## Step 6: Modify Signature Properties
```csharp
barcodeSignature.Left = 100;
barcodeSignature.Top = 100;
barcodeSignature.Width = 400;
barcodeSignature.Height = 100;
```
Here, we modify the position and size of the barcode signature as required.
## Step 7: Update the Signature
```csharp
bool result = signature.Update(barcodeSignature);
```
We call the `Update` method with the modified barcode signature to update it within the document.
## Step 8: Handle Result
```csharp
if (result)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Signature with Barcode '{barcodeSignature.Text}' and encode type '{barcodeSignature.EncodeType.TypeName}' was updated in the document ['{fileName}'].");
}
else
{
    Helper.WriteError($"Signature was not updated in the document! Signature with Barcode '{barcodeSignature.Text}' and encode type '{barcodeSignature.EncodeType.TypeName}' was not found!");
}
```
Finally, we check the result of the update operation and provide appropriate feedback based on whether it was successful or not.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to update a barcode signature within a document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily integrate this functionality into your C# applications to manipulate digital signatures as needed.

## FAQ's
### Can I update multiple barcode signatures within the same document?
Yes, you can update multiple barcode signatures by iterating through the list of found signatures and updating each one individually.
### Does GroupDocs.Signature support other types of digital signatures besides barcode?
Yes, GroupDocs.Signature supports various types of digital signatures, including text, image, QR code, and more.
### Is there a trial version available for GroupDocs.Signature for .NET?
Yes, you can download a free trial version from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/).
### Can I customize the search criteria for finding barcode signatures?
Yes, you can adjust the `BarcodeSearchOptions` to specify different search criteria such as barcode text, match type, etc.
### Where can I find support if I encounter any issues or have questions?
You can visit the GroupDocs.Signature forum [here](https://forum.groupdocs.com/c/signature/13) for support and assistance.
