# Update Text

## Introduction
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a versatile library designed to streamline the process of working with digital signatures in .NET applications. With its comprehensive set of features, developers can easily integrate digital signature functionality into their applications, allowing users to sign and update documents with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE on your system.
2. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have .NET Framework installed on your system.

## Import Namespaces
Before you can start updating text in a document, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Add the following using directives at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set up Document Path
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
```
Set the path to the document that you want to update.
## Step 2: Copy Document
```csharp
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UpdateText", fileName);
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```
Copy the source document to a new location since the `Update` method works with the same document.
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Object
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Your code here
}
```
Initialize the `Signature` object with the path to the document.
## Step 4: Search for Text Signatures
```csharp
TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions();
List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);
```
Search for text signatures within the document.
## Step 5: Update Text Signature
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    TextSignature textSignature = signatures[0];
    textSignature.Text = "John Walkman";
    textSignature.Left = textSignature.Left + 10;
    textSignature.Top = textSignature.Top + 10;
    textSignature.Width = 200;
    textSignature.Height = 100;
    bool result = signature.Update(textSignature);
    if (result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Signature with Text '{textSignature.Text}' was updated in the document ['{fileName}'].");
    }
    else
    {
        Helper.WriteError($"Signature was not updated in the document! Signature with Text '{textSignature.Text}' was not found!");
    }
}
```
Update the text signature with the desired text, position, and size.
