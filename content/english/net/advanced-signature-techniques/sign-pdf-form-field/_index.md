## Introduction
Digital signatures provide a secure and legally binding way to sign documents electronically, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to sign a PDF document that contains form fields using the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment.
3. PDF Document: Have a PDF document with form fields ready for signing.

## Import Namespaces
Make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
## Step 1: Load the PDF Document
First, specify the path to your PDF document:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
```
## Step 2: Define Output Path
Define the path where the signed document will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignPdfWithFormField", "SignedWithFormField.pdf");
```
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Object
Create an instance of the `Signature` class and pass the PDF file path to it:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Signature code will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Instantiate Form Field Signature
Next, instantiate a text form field signature with the desired field name and value:
```csharp
FormFieldSignature textSignature = new TextFormFieldSignature("FieldText", "Value1");
```
## Step 5: Configure Signature Options
Create options for signing based on the text form field signature. You can specify the position and size of the signature:
```csharp
FormFieldSignOptions options = new FormFieldSignOptions(textSignature)
{
    Top = 150,
    Left = 50,
    Height = 50,
    Width = 200
};
```
## Step 6: Sign the Document
Sign the document using the specified options and save the signed document to the output path:
```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to sign a PDF document containing form fields using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Digital signatures are essential for ensuring document authenticity and integrity in various industries.
