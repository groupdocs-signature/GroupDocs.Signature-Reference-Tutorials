# How to Sign PDF Documents with Form Fields Using GroupDocs.Signature

Are you looking for a reliable way to add digital signatures to your PDF documents with form fields? In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Let's transform your document workflow with secure, legally-binding signatures!

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before diving into the code, make sure you have:

1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download the library from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/)
2. .NET Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET-compatible IDE
3. PDF Document: A sample PDF with form fields ready for signing

## Setting Up Your Project

First, let's import all the necessary namespaces to get our project ready:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

## How Do You Load and Prepare Your PDF Document?

The first step in our signing process is loading your PDF document:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";

// Define where you want to save the signed document
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignPdfWithFormField", "SignedWithFormField.pdf");
```

## Adding Digital Signatures to Your PDF Form Fields

Now, let's create your signature and add it to the document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Create a text form field signature
    FormFieldSignature textSignature = new TextFormFieldSignature("FieldText", "Value1");
    
    // Set positioning and sizing options
    FormFieldSignOptions options = new FormFieldSignOptions(textSignature)
    {
        Top = 150,
        Left = 50,
        Height = 50,
        Width = 200
    };
    
    // Apply the signature and save the document
    SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```

With these few lines of code, you've just:
1. Loaded your PDF document
2. Created a text form field signature
3. Configured its appearance and position
4. Applied the signature to your document
