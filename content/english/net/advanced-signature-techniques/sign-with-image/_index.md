## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to sign documents using images with Groupdocs.Signature for .NET. Signing documents adds an extra layer of authenticity and security to your files, making them tamper-proof and legally binding. With the help of Groupdocs.Signature for .NET, you can seamlessly integrate document signing functionality into your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Groupdocs.Signature for .NET: Ensure you have installed Groupdocs.Signature for .NET in your development environment. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

## Import Namespaces
Before starting with the coding part, import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
The first step is to load the document that you want to sign. Provide the file path of the document you wish to sign:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
```
## Step 2: Specify Signature Image
Next, specify the path to the signature image that you want to use for signing:
```csharp
string imagePath = "signature_handwrite.jpg";
```
## Step 3: Set Output File Path
Define the path where you want to save the signed document:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignWithImage", fileName);
```
## Step 4: Initialize Signature Object
Initialize the Signature object by passing the document file path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
```
## Step 5: Set Image Signing Options
Set the options for image signing, including the signature position, whether to sign on all pages, etc.:
```csharp
ImageSignOptions options = new ImageSignOptions(imagePath)
{
    Left = 50,
    Top = 50,
    AllPages = true
};
```
## Step 6: Sign the Document
Sign the document using the specified image and options:
```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```
## Step 7: Display Result
Finally, display the result indicating the success of the signing process and the location of the signed document:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {result.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}.");
```
