## Introduction: Transform Your Document Security with Image Signatures

Have you ever wondered how to make your digital documents more secure and legally valid? Adding image signatures is one of the most effective ways to authenticate your documents and protect them from tampering. In this friendly guide, we'll walk you through the process of implementing image-based document signing in your .NET applications using GroupDocs.Signature.

Whether you're handling contracts, legal documents, or important business papers, adding a signature image not only enhances security but also streamlines your document workflow. Let's dive into how you can easily implement this powerful feature in your own applications!

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before we jump into the code, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: You'll need to download and install this library from the [GroupDocs website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/). It's the engine that powers all our signature capabilities.

2. A Working .NET Environment: Make sure you have Visual Studio or another .NET development environment ready to go on your machine.

Once you have these basics covered, you're ready to start implementing image signatures in your documents!

## Which Namespaces Do You Need?

Let's begin by importing the necessary namespaces to access all the required classes and methods:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

These imports give you access to the core functionality we'll be using throughout this tutorial.

## How Do You Implement Image Signatures?

### Step 1: Where's Your Document?

First, we need to specify which document you want to sign:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
```

This tells the application which file to process. You can use PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and many other formats.

### Step 2: Choose Your Signature Image

Next, let's specify the image you want to use as your signature:

```csharp
string imagePath = "signature_handwrite.jpg";
```

This could be a scanned handwritten signature, a company logo, or any image you want to appear as your signature.

### Step 3: Where Should We Save the Signed Document?

Now, let's decide where to save your newly signed document:

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignWithImage", fileName);
```

This creates a path to store your signed document in an organized way.

### Step 4: Create the Signature Object

Let's initialize the main Signature object that will handle our document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
```

This opens your document and prepares it for signing.

### Step 5: How Should Your Signature Look?

Now comes the fun part—customizing how your signature will appear on the document:

```csharp
ImageSignOptions options = new ImageSignOptions(imagePath)
{
    Left = 50,
    Top = 50,
    AllPages = true
};
```

Here you can set the position of your signature and choose whether to apply it to all pages or just specific ones.

### Step 6: Apply the Signature

With everything set up, let's apply the signature to your document:

```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

This single line does the heavy lifting—applying your image signature to the document based on all your specifications.

### Step 7: How Did It Go?

Finally, let's show a message confirming that everything worked as expected:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {result.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}.");
```

This gives you and your users feedback about the success of the operation.
