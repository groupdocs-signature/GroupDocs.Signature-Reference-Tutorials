# How to Add Text Signatures to Documents Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction: Modernize Your Document Signing Process

Ever wondered how to add professional text signatures to your documents programmatically? In today's digital world, physical signatures are increasingly being replaced by electronic alternatives that save time, reduce paper waste, and streamline workflow processes.

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers you a powerful, flexible solution for adding customized text signatures to virtually any document format. Whether you're developing business applications, document management systems, or simply need to automate your signing process, this tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything ready:

1. GroupDocs.Signature Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET package from [the releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).

2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

3. Sample Document: Have a document ready that you want to sign. This could be a PDF, Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or any other supported format.

## Setting Up Your Project: Required Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project. These will give you access to all the GroupDocs.Signature functionality you'll need:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Drawing;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

Now let's break down the process of adding a text signature into simple, manageable steps:

## Step 1: How Do You Load Your Document?

First, we need to specify which document you want to sign:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf"; // Path to your document
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
```

## Step 2: Where Should the Signed Document Be Saved?

Next, let's define where your newly signed document will be stored:

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignWithText", fileName);
```

## Step 3: How Can You Customize Your Text Signature?

This is where it gets interesting! You can fully customize how your text signature will appear:

```csharp
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
{
    Left = 50,                  // Horizontal position on the page
    Top = 200,                  // Vertical position on the page
    Width = 100,                // Width of signature area
    Height = 30,                // Height of signature area
    ForeColor = Color.Red,      // Text color
    Font = new SignatureFont { 
        Size = 14, 
        FamilyName = "Comic Sans MS" 
    }
};
```

You can adjust these parameters to match your branding requirements or document style. Want a blue signature in Arial font? Just change the color and font family. Need the signature in a different location? Adjust the position coordinates.

## Step 4: How Do You Apply the Signature to Your Document?

Finally, let's apply the signature and save the document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {result.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).");
    Console.WriteLine($"Signed document saved at: {outputFilePath}");
}
```

And voil√†! Your document now contains a professional text signature exactly where you wanted it.

## Real-World Application Examples

Here are some practical ways you might use text signatures:

- Contract Approvals: Add "Approved by Finance Department" text signatures to contracts
- Document Verification: Include "Verified on [Date]" text signatures for compliance
- Personalized Certificates: Generate certificates with recipient names as text signatures
- Document Classification: Mark documents as "Confidential" or "Draft" with prominent text
