# Signing with Barcode

## Introduction
In today's digital age, securing documents with signatures is paramount, and GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers a seamless solution for integrating barcode signatures into your applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of signing a document with a barcode using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Signature for .NET from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up.
3. Document to Sign: Prepare the document (e.g., PDF) that you want to sign with a barcode.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the functionality of GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```
## Step 1: Specify Document Path and File Name
Begin by specifying the path to the document you want to sign with a barcode. Also, extract the file name from the path.
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
```
## Step 2: Set Output File Path
Define the output file path where the signed document will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SignWithBarcode", fileName);
```
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Object
Instantiate a Signature object by passing the path of the document to be signed.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your code for barcode signing goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Create Barcode Sign Options
Create an instance of BarcodeSignOptions and configure it according to your requirements.
```csharp
BarcodeSignOptions options = new BarcodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
	// Specify barcode encoding type
	
    EncodeType = BarcodeTypes.Code128,
    // Set signature position (left)
	Left = 50,
	// Set signature position (top)
    Top = 150,
	// Set barcode width
    Width = 200,
	// Set barcode height
    Height = 50
};
```
## Step 5: Sign the Document
Invoke the Sign method of the Signature object, passing the output file path and barcode sign options.
```csharp
SignResult result = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```
