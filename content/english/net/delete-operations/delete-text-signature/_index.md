## Introduction
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to seamlessly integrate electronic signature functionality into their .NET applications. Whether you're building a document management system, a contract signing platform, or any other application that requires signature functionality, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET provides a comprehensive set of tools to simplify the process.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. .NET Development Environment
Ensure that you have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. You can download and install the .NET SDK from the Microsoft website.
### 2. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
Download and install GroupDocs.Signature for .NET from the provided link: [Download GroupDocs.Signature for .NET](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/)
### 3. Document for Testing
Prepare a sample document (e.g., a Word document, PDF, etc.) that you'll use to test the signature deletion functionality.

## Import Namespaces
To begin using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET in your project, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

Now, let's break down the process of deleting a text signature from a document into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define File Paths
First, define the paths for your input document, output document, and file name.
```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "DeleteText", fileName);
```
## Step 2: Copy Source File
Since the `Delete` method works with the same document, copy the source file to a new location.
```csharp
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Object
Initialize a `Signature` object using the output file path.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Code for deleting text signature will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Search for Text Signatures
Search for text signatures within the document using `TextSearchOptions`.
```csharp
TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions();
List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);
```
## Step 5: Delete Text Signature
If text signatures are found, delete the first one.
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    TextSignature textSignature = signatures[0];
    bool result = signature.Delete(textSignature);
    if (result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Signature with Text '{textSignature.Text}' was deleted from document ['{fileName}'].");
    }
    else
    {
        Helper.WriteError($"Signature was not deleted from the document! Signature with Text '{textSignature.Text}' was not found!");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers a straightforward approach to deleting text signatures from documents programmatically. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, developers can seamlessly integrate signature deletion functionality into their .NET applications, enhancing document management processes and ensuring compliance with electronic signature standards.
