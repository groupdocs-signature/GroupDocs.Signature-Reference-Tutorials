# How to Remove Multiple Signatures from Documents in .NET

## Why Managing Document Signatures Matters

Have you ever needed to clean up a document by removing several signatures at once? In today's digital workspace, efficiently managing document signatures can save you countless hours and streamline your workflow. Whether you're updating legal contracts, refreshing templates, or preparing documents for new approvals, the ability to programmatically remove multiple signatures is invaluable.

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET makes this process remarkably simple. In this guide, we'll walk you through exactly how to delete multiple signatures from your documents with just a few lines of code.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything ready:

* Basic familiarity with C# programming (don't worry, we'll explain each step clearly)
* GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library installed in your project
* A test document that contains multiple signatures you'd like to remove

If you're missing any of these items, take a moment to get set up before continuing. Your future self will thank you!

## Setting Up Your Project Environment

First, let's import the necessary namespaces to access all the powerful functionality of GroupDocs.Signature:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

These imports give you access to the core functionality you'll need for managing signatures in your documents.

## How Do You Prepare Your Document?

Let's start by setting up the file path and creating a working copy of your document:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample_multiple_signatures.docx";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
```

We always recommend working with a copy of your original document. This prevents any accidental changes to your source file:

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "DeleteMultiple", fileName);
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```

## Creating Your Signature Processing Engine

Now, let's initialize the signature object that will handle all our document operations:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // We'll add our signature processing code here shortly
}
```

This creates a powerful processing engine that understands your document's structure and can identify and manipulate signatures within it.

## How Do You Find All Signatures in a Document?

To remove signatures, we first need to find them. GroupDocs.Signature can identify various types of signatures in your document:

```csharp
TextSearchOptions textSearchOptions = new TextSearchOptions();
ImageSearchOptions imageSearchOptions = new ImageSearchOptions();
BarcodeSearchOptions barcodeOptions = new BarcodeSearchOptions();
QrCodeSearchOptions qrCodeOptions = new QrCodeSearchOptions();

// Combine all our search options
List<SearchOptions> listOptions = new List<SearchOptions>();
listOptions.Add(textSearchOptions);
listOptions.Add(imageSearchOptions);
listOptions.Add(barcodeOptions);
listOptions.Add(qrCodeOptions);
```

With these options configured, we can now search for all signatures in the document:

```csharp
SearchResult result = signature.Search(listOptions);
```

## Removing the Signatures with a Single Operation

Once we've found all the signatures, removing them is straightforward:

```csharp
if (result.Signatures.Count > 0)
{
    // Attempt to delete all signatures at once
    DeleteResult deleteResult = signature.Delete(result.Signatures);
    
    // Let's check how successful we were
    if(deleteResult.Succeeded.Count == result.Signatures.Count)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\nAll signatures were successfully deleted!");                        
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Successfully deleted signatures: {deleteResult.Succeeded.Count}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Signatures not deleted: {deleteResult.Failed.Count}");
    }
    
    // Display details about what we deleted
    Console.WriteLine("\nList of deleted signatures:");
    int number = 1;
    foreach(BaseSignature temp in deleteResult.Succeeded)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Signature #{number++}: Type: {temp.SignatureType} Id:{temp.SignatureId}, Location: {temp.Left}x{temp.Top}. Size: {temp.Width}x{temp.Height}");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("No signatures were found in the document.");
}
```

This code not only removes the signatures but also provides helpful feedback about what was deleted and where those signatures were located in your document.

## What Have We Learned?

Managing document signatures doesn't have to be complicated. With GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you can:

1. Easily identify different types of signatures in your documents
2. Remove multiple signatures in a single operation
3. Track which signatures were successfully removed
4. Get detailed information about each signature's properties

This approach saves you from tedious manual editing and helps maintain document integrity throughout your workflow.

By incorporating this functionality into your applications, you'll give your users a seamless document management experience that handles signature removal effortlessly.
