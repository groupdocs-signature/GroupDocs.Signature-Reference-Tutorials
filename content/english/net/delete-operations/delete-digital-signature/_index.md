## Introduction
In the world of digital documents, ensuring authenticity and security is paramount. Digital signatures play a crucial role in verifying the integrity of electronic documents. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers powerful tools to manage digital signatures within .NET applications efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to delete digital signatures from documents, ensure you have the following:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE on your system.
2. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Signature for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
3. Sample Document: Prepare a sample document containing digital signatures for testing.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, make sure to import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```
## Step 1: Define File Paths
Start by defining the file paths for the source document and the output document:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf"_SIGNED_DIGITAL;
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "DeleteDigital", fileName);
```
## Step 2: Copy the Source Document
Since the `Delete` method works with the same document, it's necessary to copy the source file to a new location:
```csharp
File.Copy(filePath, outputFilePath, true);
```
## Step 3: Initialize Signature Object
Initialize a `Signature` object with the output file path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(outputFilePath))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Search for Digital Signatures
Search for electronic digital signatures within the document:
```csharp
List<DigitalSignature> signatures = signature.Search<DigitalSignature>(SignatureType.Digital);
```
## Step 5: Delete Digital Signature
If digital signatures are found, delete the first signature found:
```csharp
if (signatures.Count > 0)
{
    DigitalSignature digitalSignature = signatures[0];
    bool result = signature.Delete(digitalSignature);
    if (result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Digital signature #{digitalSignature.Thumbprint} from {digitalSignature.SignTime.ToShortDateString()} was deleted from document ['{fileName}'].");
    }
    else
    {
        Helper.WriteError($"Signature was not deleted from the document! Signature# {digitalSignature.Thumbprint} was not found!");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Managing digital signatures in .NET applications becomes effortless with GroupDocs.Signature. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can seamlessly delete digital signatures from your documents, ensuring data integrity and security.
