- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with document management concepts and GroupDocs.Signature library usage.

### Required Libraries

Ensure that you have **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET** installed. You can add it to your project using:

#### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

#### Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

#### NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore the features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for production use.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Let's get your environment ready to work with GroupDocs.Signature. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once you've added the library, initialize it in your application as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize a Signature object
Signature signature = new Signature("sample.docx");
```

This sets the stage for leveraging custom serialization and encryption features.

## Implementation Guide

### Custom Serialization Class with GroupDocs.Signature

#### Overview
Custom serialization allows you to define how your metadata is structured and stored within documents, providing flexibility in data management.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Define a Custom Class
Start by creating a class that utilizes custom serialization attributes:

```csharp
[CustomSerialization]
private class DocumentSignatureData
{
    [Format("SignID")]
    public string ID { get; set; }

    [Format("SAuth")]
    public string Author { get; set; }

    [Format("SDate", "yyyy-MM-dd")]
    public DateTime Signed { get; set; }

    [Format("SDFact", "N2")]
    public decimal DataFactor { get; set; }

    [SkipSerialization]
    public string Comments { get; set; }
}
```

- **Attributes Explained**:
  - `[CustomSerialization]`: Marks the class for custom serialization.
  - `[Format("SignID")]`: Maps the `ID` property to "SignID" in metadata.
  - `[SkipSerialization]`: Excludes `Comments` from being serialized.

### Metadata Signature Search with Custom Encryption

#### Overview
This feature allows you to search document metadata using custom encryption, ensuring data security during retrieval.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Implement Custom Encryption and Search
Set up your method to perform a secure metadata signature search:

```csharp
public static void SearchMetadataWithCustomEncryption()
{
    string filePath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_METADATA_CUSTOM_SERIALIZATION_OBJECT";

    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        IDataEncryption encryption = new CustomXOREncryption();
        
        MetadataSearchOptions options = new MetadataSearchOptions
        {
            DataEncryption = encryption
        };

        List<WordProcessingMetadataSignature> signatures =
            signature.Search<WordProcessingMetadataSignature>(options);

        WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdSignature = 
            signatures.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == "Signature");
        if (mdSignature != null)
        {
            DocumentSignatureData documentSignatureData = 
                mdSignature.GetData<DocumentSignatureData>();
            Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Author = {1}, Signed = {2}, DataFactor {3}",
                documentSignatureData.ID, documentSignatureData.Author,
                documentSignatureData.Signed.ToShortDateString(), documentSignatureData.DataFactor);
        }

        WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdAuthor = 
            signatures.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == "Author");
        if (mdAuthor != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Metadata signature found. Name : {0}. Value: {1}", 
                mdAuthor.Name, mdAuthor.GetData<string>());
        }

        WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdDocId = 
            signatures.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == "DocumentId");
        if (mdDocId != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Metadata signature found. Name : {0}. Value: {1}", 
                mdDocId.Name, mdDocId.GetData<string>());
        }
    }
}
```

- **Encryption**: `CustomXOREncryption` ensures data privacy during the search process.
- **Search Options**: Configured with custom encryption for secure metadata retrieval.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure correct file paths and permissions.
- Verify that the encryption algorithm matches your document’s configuration.

## Practical Applications
