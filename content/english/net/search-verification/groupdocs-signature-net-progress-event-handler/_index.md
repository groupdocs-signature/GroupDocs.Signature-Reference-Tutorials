# Optimize Document Searches with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Implement Progress Event Handlers

## Introduction

Are you facing challenges in handling long-running document search processes efficiently? With the advent of digital documents, managing performance is crucial, especially when dealing with large files or complex operations. This tutorial introduces an effective solution using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to cancel slow searches based on a predefined time threshold. By implementing a progress event handler, you can optimize your document management applications, ensuring responsiveness and efficiency.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and use the progress event handler feature in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to manage search operations seamlessly. You will learn:
- How to integrate GroupDocs.Signature for .NET into your project
- How to define a progress event handler to cancel slow searches
- Practical applications of this functionality in real-world scenarios

Let's dive into the prerequisites and get started with enhancing your document management capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following setup:
- **Libraries and Dependencies**: You'll need GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Make sure it’s installed via NuGet or another package manager.
- **Environment Setup**: A development environment supporting .NET Framework or .NET Core is required.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with C# programming and basic understanding of event-driven architecture will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To get started, you need to install the GroupDocs.Signature library. Here’s how:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**With Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

Or, use the NuGet Package Manager UI by searching for "GroupDocs.Signature" and installing the latest version.

### License Acquisition

You can start with a free trial or apply for a temporary license to explore all features without limitations. For long-term projects, consider purchasing a full license through GroupDocs's official purchase page.

Once installed, you can initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your project as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
```

This sets the stage for implementing our progress event handler feature.

## Implementation Guide

### Progress Event Handler Feature

Our goal is to cancel searches that take longer than 100 milliseconds. This ensures efficient use of resources and enhances user experience by not allowing slow operations to hang or delay other processes.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define the Progress Event Handler**

Create a class `ProgressEventHandler` with a method `OnSearchProgress`:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

public class ProgressEventHandler
{
    private static void OnSearchProgress(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args)
    {
        // Cancel the process if it exceeds 100 milliseconds
        if (args.Ticks > 100)
        {
            args.Cancel = true; 
        }
    }
}
```

In this method:
- We use `ProcessProgressEventArgs` to check how long the search operation is taking (`Ticks`).
- If it surpasses 100 ticks, we set `args.Cancel` to `true`, effectively stopping the process.

**2. Implement Document Search and Cancellation Process**

Create a class `DocumentSearchCancellationProcess`:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

public class DocumentSearchCancellationProcess
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";

        using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            // Attach the progress event handler
            signature.SearchProgress += ProgressEventHandler.OnSearchProgress;

            TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions("Text signature");

            List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);

            foreach (var textSignature in signatures)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Text signature found at page {0} with text {1}", textSignature.PageNumber, textSignature.Text);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this section:
- We initialize a `Signature` object and attach our progress handler.
- Configure the search options for finding text signatures within documents.
- Execute the search, logging results or cancellation as necessary.

### Practical Applications

This functionality is beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **High-Volume Document Processing**: Quickly filter out slow searches to maintain throughput.
2. **User Interface Responsiveness**: Cancel lagging operations to keep UIs responsive.
3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Optimize resource usage by avoiding long-running tasks.
4. **Integration with Automation Tools**: Seamlessly cancel operations in batch processes or when integrating with other systems like ERP software.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider these tips:
- Monitor and adjust the cancellation threshold based on typical search durations.
- Use asynchronous programming models where possible to prevent blocking main threads.
- Regularly profile your application to identify bottlenecks related to document processing.

Follow best practices for .NET memory management by disposing of objects properly and utilizing `using` statements as shown above.

## Conclusion

By implementing the progress event handler in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you've taken a significant step towards improving your application's performance. This guide has equipped you with the knowledge to effectively manage document search processes, ensuring they are both efficient and responsive.
