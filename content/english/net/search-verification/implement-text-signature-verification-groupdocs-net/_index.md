## How to Implement Text Signature Verification with Event Subscriptions using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

### Introduction
In today's digital landscape, verifying document authenticity is vital for maintaining trust and security. This tutorial guides you through implementing text signature verification with event subscriptions in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. By leveraging this powerful library, ensure document integrity efficiently.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Set up and use GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
- Implement event subscription for the verification process.
- Handle start, progress, and completion events during text signature verification.
- Explore real-world applications of this feature.

Now, let's review the prerequisites you need before getting started!

### Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

- **Required Libraries:** Install GroupDocs.Signature for .NET (version 22.x or later).
- **Environment Setup:** Use a .NET development environment like Visual Studio.
- **Knowledge Requirements:** Understand C# basics and have familiarity with .NET applications.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
To start, install the GroupDocs.Signature library:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
Access a free trial from [release page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/). For extended use, purchase a license or obtain a temporary one through [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization
Set up GroupDocs.Signature in your .NET application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize the Signature object with the path of your document.
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
```
With this setup, you're ready to implement text signature verification with event subscriptions!

## Implementation Guide
This section breaks down the implementation process into logical steps. Each feature is covered in detail.

### Event Subscription for Verification Process
Subscribe to various events during document verification using GroupDocs.Signature.

#### Overview
Subscribing to start, progress, and completion events allows you to monitor the verification process of your documents. This approach is useful for logging or updating a user interface in real-time.

##### Step 1: Define Event Handlers
Define handlers triggered at different stages of the verification process:

```csharp
private static void OnVerifyStarted(Signature sender, ProcessStartEventArgs args)
{
    // Log the start of the verify process
    Console.WriteLine("Verify process started at {0} with {1} total signatures to be put in document", args.Started, args.TotalSignatures);
}

private static void OnVerifyProgress(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args)
{
    // Log the current verification progress
    Console.WriteLine("Verify progress. Processed {0} signatures. Time spent {1} mlsec", args.ProcessedSignatures, args.Ticks);
}

private static void OnVerifyCompleted(Signature sender, ProcessCompleteEventArgs args)
{
    // Log the completion of the verify process
    Console.WriteLine("Verify process completed at {0} with {1} total signatures. Process took {2} mlsec", args.Completed, args.TotalSignatures, args.Ticks);
}
```
##### Step 2: Subscribe to Events
Subscribe to these events within your verification method:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

public static void RunVerificationWithEvents()
{
    string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        // Subscribe to the verification events
        signature.VerifyStarted += OnVerifyStarted;
        signature.VerifyProgress += OnVerifyProgress;
        signature.VerifyCompleted += OnVerifyCompleted;

        TextVerifyOptions verifyOptions = new TextVerifyOptions("Text signature")
        {
            AllPages = false,
            PageNumber = 1
        };

        VerificationResult result = signature.Verify(verifyOptions);

        if (result.IsValid)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("
Document was verified successfully!
");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("
Document failed verification process.
");
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**
- **`TextVerifyOptions`:** Configures criteria for signature verification.
- **Event Subscription:** Attaches event handlers to monitor the verification lifecycle.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- Handle exceptions during file access or processing.

### Document Verification with Text Signature and Event Subscription
This feature demonstrates verifying a specific text signature in a document while subscribing to various events for real-time monitoring.

## Practical Applications
Here are some practical use cases:
1. **Legal Documentation:** Automatically verify signatures on legal contracts before submission.
2. **Financial Transactions:** Ensure the authenticity of signed financial documents in banking systems.
3. **HR Processes:** Validate signed employment agreements or non-disclosure forms.
4. **E-commerce Verification:** Check integrity of purchase orders and invoices.
5. **Academic Certifications:** Verify authenticity before issuance.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance, consider:
- **Resource Management:** Dispose of `Signature` objects properly to free resources.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple documents in batches for efficient memory usage.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous methods for enhanced responsiveness.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to implement text signature verification with event subscriptions using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This feature enhances document security and provides real-time feedback during the verification process.

**Next Steps:**
- Explore further customization options in GroupDocs.Signature.
- Integrate with other systems or applications as needed.
