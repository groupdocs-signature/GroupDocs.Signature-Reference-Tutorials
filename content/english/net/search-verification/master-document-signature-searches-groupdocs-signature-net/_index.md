## Implementation Guide

### Text Signature Search

#### Overview

This feature allows you to search for text-based signatures across all pages of a document, making it easy to verify the presence and location of signed content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Search Options**
   
   Configure options to search for text signatures across all pages:
   
   ```csharp
   using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
   
   TextSearchOptions textOptions = new TextSearchOptions() { AllPages = true };
   ```

2. **Execute the Search**
   
   Use these options to perform a text signature search:
   
   ```csharp
   SearchResult result = signature.Search(textOptions);
   ```

3. **Process Results**
   
   Iterate through found signatures and display details:
   
   ```csharp
   if (result.Signatures.Count > 0) {
       foreach (var resSignature in result.Signatures) {
           Console.WriteLine($"Text signature found at page {resSignature.PageNumber} with type {resSignature.SignatureType} and Id#: {resSignature.SignatureId}");
       }
   } else {
       Console.WriteLine("No text signatures were found.");
   }
   ```

### Digital Signature Search

#### Overview

Similar to text searches, this feature lets you locate digital signatures throughout your document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Search Options**
   
   Set up options for a comprehensive search:
   
   ```csharp
   using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
   
   DigitalSearchOptions digitalOptions = new DigitalSearchOptions() { AllPages = true };
   ```

2. **Execute the Search**
   
   Perform the search with your defined options:
   
   ```csharp
   SearchResult result = signature.Search(digitalOptions);
   ```

3. **Process Results**
   
   Output details of any found signatures:
   
   ```csharp
   if (result.Signatures.Count > 0) {
       foreach (var resSignature in result.Signatures) {
           Console.WriteLine($"Digital signature found at page {resSignature.PageNumber} with type {resSignature.SignatureType} and Id#: {resSignature.SignatureId}");
       }
   } else {
       Console.WriteLine("No digital signatures were found.");
   }
   ```

## Practical Applications

- **Contract Management:** Quickly verify all parties have signed a contract.
- **Legal Document Verification:** Ensure legal documents bear necessary electronic endorsements.
- **Record Keeping:** Maintain an audit trail of document signings.
