## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up the environment, let's implement the feature to verify text signatures within a document. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Feature Overview: Verify Text Signature
This section demonstrates verifying if specified text exists as part of the signature in any or all pages of your document.

#### Step 1: Load the Document
Firstly, create an instance of the `Signature` class to load your document. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI"` with the path to your document:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Verification code will be added here.
}
```

#### Step 2: Define Verification Options
Next, define options for verifying text signatures. These options allow you to specify the criteria for verification:

```csharp
TextVerifyOptions options = new TextVerifyOptions()
{
    AllPages = true,
    SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Native,
    Text = "signature\
