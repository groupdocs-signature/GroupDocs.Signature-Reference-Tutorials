### Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll break down each feature of GroupDocs.Signature for .NET into actionable steps. 

#### Feature: Search for Text Signatures
Searching text signatures within a document is essential for validation tasks. Here's how you can achieve it:

##### Initialize Signature Instance
Start by creating an instance of the `Signature` class, which will manage your document.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";

// Create a new Signature object with the path to your document.
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```

##### Configure Search Options
To search for text signatures, configure `TextSearchOptions` accordingly. This setup allows you to specify whether to search across all pages or just the first.

```csharp
// Create TextSearchOptions to define your search parameters.
TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions()
{
    AllPages = false // Set this to true if searching beyond the first page is needed.
};
```

##### Execute Search
With options configured, execute the search for text signatures within your document.

```csharp
// Retrieve a list of found text signatures based on specified options.
List<TextSignature> signatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);

Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains the following signatures.");
foreach (TextSignature textSignature in signatures)
{
    if (textSignature != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found Text signature at page {textSignature.PageNumber}, with type [{textSignature.SignatureImplementation}] and text '{textSignature.Text}'.");
        Console.WriteLine($"Located at coordinates {textSignature.Left}-{textSignature.Top}. Size is {textSignature.Width}x{textSignature.Height}.");
    }
}
```

##### Skip External Signatures During Search
In scenarios where you want to ignore external objects, adjust the `TextSearchOptions`.

```csharp
// Adjust TextSearchOptions to skip non-signature elements.
options.SkipExternal = true; // This will exclude any external signatures from results.

List<TextSignature> internalSignatures = signature.Search<TextSignature>(options);
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains {internalSignatures.Count} non-external signatures.");
```

### Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is versatile. Here are some use cases:
1. **Contract Management**: Quickly verify digital signatures on contracts.
2. **Invoice Processing**: Automate the verification of signatures on invoices to ensure authenticity.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Use signature tracking in compliance documentation.

Integration with other systems, such as CRM or ERP, allows for seamless workflow automation and data management.

### Performance Considerations
To maximize performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Process documents asynchronously where possible.
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of objects after use.
- For large-scale operations, consider processing in batches to optimize resource usage.
