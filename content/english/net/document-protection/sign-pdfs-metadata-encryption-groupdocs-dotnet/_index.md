## Implementation Guide

### Metadata Signature Data Class

**Overview:**
Define a data class that holds metadata information for signing. This class will be used to hold various attributes like ID, Author, Signed date, and DataFactor with specific formats.

#### Step 1: Define the Data Class
```csharp
using System;

namespace GroupDocs.Signature.Domain
{
    public class DocumentSignatureData
    {
        [Format("SignID")]
        public string ID { get; set; }

        [Format("SAuth")]
        public string Author { get; set; }

        [Format("SDate", "yyyy-MM-dd")]
        public DateTime Signed { get; set; }

        [Format("SDFact", "N2")]
        public decimal DataFactor { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `ID`, `Author`, `Signed`, and `DataFactor` are properties with specific formats defined using `[Format]`.
- This setup ensures that metadata is consistently formatted for signing.

### Metadata Signature Creation and Encryption

**Overview:**
Learn how to create and encrypt metadata signatures using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.

#### Step 2: Set Up Symmetric Encryption
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

namespace MetadataSignatureCreation
{
    public class CreateMetadataSignatures
    {
        string key = "1234567890"; // Use a secure key in production
        string salt = "1234567890"; // Use a secure salt in production

        IDataEncryption encryption = new SymmetricEncryption(SymmetricAlgorithmType.Rijndael, key, salt);

        DocumentSignatureData documentSignature = new DocumentSignatureData()
        {
            ID = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            Author = Environment.UserName,
            Signed = DateTime.Now,
            DataFactor = 11.22M
        };

        PdfMetadataSignature mdDocument = new PdfMetadataSignature("DocumentSignature", documentSignature);
        mdDocument.DataEncryption = encryption;

        PdfMetadataSignature mdAuthor = new PdfMetadataSignature("Author", "Mr.Sherlock Holmes");
        mdAuthor.DataEncryption = encryption;

        PdfMetadataSignature mdDocId = new PdfMetadataSignature("DocumentId", Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
        mdDocId.DataEncryption = encryption;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `SymmetricEncryption` is set up with a key and salt, ensuring secure encryption of metadata.
- Metadata signatures are created for document details and author information.

### Signing PDF with Metadata Signatures

**Overview:**
Implement the signing process using the GroupDocs.Signature library to sign your PDF documents with the prepared metadata signatures.

#### Step 3: Sign the PDF
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

namespace SignPdfWithMetadata
{
    public class SignPdf
    {
        string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf");
        string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
        string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignPdfWithCustomMetadata", fileName);

        public void Execute()
        {
            using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
            {
                MetadataSignOptions options = new MetadataSignOptions();

                CreateMetadataSignatures signer = new CreateMetadataSignatures();
                options.Add(signer.mdDocument);
                options.Add(signer.mdAuthor);
                options.Add(signer.mdDocId);

                SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `Signature` class initializes with the PDF file path.
- `MetadataSignOptions` is used to add metadata signatures for signing.
- The signed document is saved at the specified output path.

## Practical Applications

### Real-world Use Cases
1. **Legal Document Signing**: Automatically sign contracts and agreements with encrypted metadata for added security.
2. **Invoice Management**: Digitally sign invoices, embedding customer and transaction details securely.
3. **Certification Issuance**: Issue certificates that include encrypted metadata such as issuance date and recipient information.

### Integration Possibilities
- Integrate with CRM systems to automate signature workflows.
- Combine with document management solutions for secure archiving of signed documents.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Signature, consider these performance tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of resources promptly after use.
