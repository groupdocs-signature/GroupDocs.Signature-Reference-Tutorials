{
    // Your document signing logic goes here
}
```

Notice how we're using the `using` statement? This ensures proper resource disposal—crucial for performance in automated workflows.

## Core Feature Implementation

Let's tackle the three essential features that'll transform your document signing workflow: handling password-protected files, implementing smart logging, and adding QR code signatures.

### Feature 1: Automated Password-Protected Document Access

#### Why This Matters

Manual password entry breaks automation. Every time your workflow hits a password-protected document, productivity stops. Here's how to eliminate that bottleneck entirely.

#### The Implementation

**Step 1: Configure Password Management**

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

public class FeatureLoadPasswordProtectedDocument
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample_pdf_signed_pwd.pdf";
        
        // Set the correct password to load the document
        LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions() { Password = "12345678901" };

        using (var signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions))
        {
            // Document is now loaded and ready for processing
            Console.WriteLine("Password-protected document loaded successfully!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application**: Imagine processing monthly reports where each department uses different passwords. You can store these securely (using Azure Key Vault or similar) and automate the entire workflow.

#### Common Integration Challenges

**Challenge**: "How do I handle different passwords for different document types?"

**Solution**: Create a password mapping system:

```csharp
var passwordMap = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["legal_contracts"] = "legal_pwd_123",
    ["financial_reports"] = "finance_pwd_456",
    ["hr_documents"] = "hr_pwd_789"
};
```

**Challenge**: "What if the password is wrong?"

**Solution**: Always implement proper exception handling to avoid workflow interruptions.

### Feature 2: Intelligent Console Logging

#### Why Logging is Critical for Automation

When you're processing hundreds of documents automatically, you need visibility into what's happening. Poor logging turns troubleshooting into guesswork.

#### Smart Logging Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Logging;

public class FeatureConsoleLogging
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        var logger = new ConsoleLogger();
        
        // Configure logging levels based on your needs
        var settings = new SignatureSettings(logger)
        {
            LogLevel = LogLevel.Trace | LogLevel.Warning | LogLevel.Error
        };

        Console.WriteLine("Logging system initialized - ready to track all signing operations!");
    }
}
```

#### Logging Best Practices for Production

**For Development**: Use `Trace` level to see everything
**For Production**: Stick to `Warning | Error` to avoid log pollution
**For Debugging**: Temporarily enable `Trace` when investigating issues

**Pro Tip**: Consider integrating with application insights or similar tools for better log management in production environments.

### Feature 3: QR Code Signature Integration

#### Why QR Codes Enhance Security

QR codes provide both digital verification and visual confirmation. They're perfect for documents that need quick verification without specialized software.

#### Complete QR Code Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

public class FeatureSignDocumentWithQRCode
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample_pdf_signed_pwd.pdf";
        string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "signed_output.pdf");

        using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            // Create QR code options with customizable properties
            QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("Sample Data")
            {
                EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
                Left = 100,
                Top = 100,
                Width = 200,
                Height = 200
            };

            // Execute the signing process
            signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
            Console.WriteLine("Document successfully signed with QR code!");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Customizing QR Codes for Your Workflow

**Data Encoding Options**: You can embed URLs, contact info, or verification codes
**Positioning**: Place QR codes strategically (avoid overlapping with existing content)
**Size Considerations**: Larger QR codes are easier to scan but take more space

## Real-World Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legal Document Processing

You're handling 50+ legal contracts daily, each requiring specific signatures and verification:

```csharp
// Batch process legal documents with different signature requirements
foreach (var contract in legalContracts)
{
    using (var signature = new Signature(contract.FilePath, contract.LoadOptions))
    {
        // Add QR code with contract verification data
        var qrOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions(contract.VerificationCode)
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = contract.SignaturePosition.X,
            Top = contract.SignaturePosition.Y
        };
        
        signature.Sign(contract.OutputPath, qrOptions);
    }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Financial Report Automation

Monthly financial reports need signatures from multiple departments:

- Load password-protected files automatically
- Apply department-specific QR codes
- Generate audit logs for compliance

### Scenario 3: HR Document Management

Employee onboarding involves multiple password-protected forms. Automation reduces processing time from hours to minutes while maintaining security standards.

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Memory Management Best Practices

**Always use `using` statements**: This ensures proper disposal of resources
**Process documents in batches**: Don't load all documents into memory simultaneously
**Monitor memory usage**: Especially important when processing large PDFs

### Speed Optimization Strategies

1. **Preload password configurations**: Don't fetch passwords for each document
2. **Optimize QR code positioning**: Calculate positions once, reuse for similar documents
3. **Use asynchronous processing**: For bulk operations, consider async/await patterns

### Error Handling for Production Workflows

```csharp
try
{
    using (var signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions))
    {
        // Your signing logic here
    }
}
catch (IncorrectPasswordException ex)
{
    // Handle password issues gracefully
    logger.LogError($"Password incorrect for {filePath}: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle other potential issues
    logger.LogError($"Signing failed for {filePath}: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Common Integration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "My existing workflow uses different document formats"

**Solution**: GroupDocs.Signature supports multiple formats (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint). You can handle different formats in the same workflow:

```csharp
var supportedFormats = new[] { ".pdf", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".pptx" };
if (supportedFormats.Contains(Path.GetExtension(filePath).ToLower()))
{
    // Process the document
}
```

### Challenge: "Integration with our existing authentication system"

**Solution**: Create an adapter that bridges your authentication system with GroupDocs password management. Store encrypted passwords securely and decrypt them only when needed.

### Challenge: "Bulk processing performance issues"

**Solution**: Implement parallel processing for independent documents, but be mindful of system resources:

```csharp
await Task.Run(() => Parallel.ForEach(documents, ProcessDocument));
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "Document won't load with correct password"
- **Check**: File corruption or encoding issues
- **Solution**: Verify file integrity and try opening manually first

**Problem**: "QR codes appear in wrong positions"
- **Check**: Document margins and existing content
- **Solution**: Calculate positions dynamically based on document dimensions

**Problem**: "Logging isn't showing expected information"
