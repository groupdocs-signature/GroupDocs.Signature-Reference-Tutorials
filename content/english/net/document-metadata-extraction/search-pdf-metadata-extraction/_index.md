## Introduction
In the realm of digital document management, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of files is paramount. One essential aspect of this is the ability to search PDF metadata efficiently. Metadata signatures within PDF documents provide valuable information about the file's origin, authorship, and content.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Sample PDF File: Prepare a sample PDF file with metadata signatures to test the extraction process.

## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities of GroupDocs.Signature:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```
### Step 1: Load the PDF Document
Begin by specifying the path to the PDF document containing the metadata signatures:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.pdf";
```
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Create an instance of the `Signature` class and pass the file path as a parameter:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code block for metadata extraction will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Search for Metadata Signatures
Utilize the `Search` method to look for metadata signatures within the PDF document:
```csharp
List<PdfMetadataSignature> signatures = signature.Search<PdfMetadataSignature>(SignatureType.Metadata);
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Signatures
Loop through the extracted metadata signatures to access their details:
```csharp
foreach (PdfMetadataSignature mdSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\t[{mdSignature.TagPrefix} : {mdSignature.Name}] = {mdSignature.Value} ({mdSignature.Type})");
}
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Signature for .NET simplifies the process of searching PDF metadata signatures, enabling developers to efficiently extract vital information from digital documents. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate metadata extraction functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing document management capabilities.
