{
```
## Step 3: Search for Signatures
Utilize the `Search` method to search for signatures within the document. Specify the signature type as `SignatureType.Metadata` to focus on metadata signatures:
```csharp
List<WordProcessingMetadataSignature> signatures = signature.Search<WordProcessingMetadataSignature>(SignatureType.Metadata);
```
## Step 4: Display Signatures
Iterate through the retrieved signatures and display their details:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains the following signatures:");
foreach (WordProcessingMetadataSignature mdSignature in signatures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\t[{mdSignature.Name}] = {mdSignature.Value} ({mdSignature.Type})");
}
```
