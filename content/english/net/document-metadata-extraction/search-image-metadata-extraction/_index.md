# How to Search Image Metadata in Documents Using GroupDocs.Signature

## Introduction

Ever wondered how to verify if your important documents are authentic and haven't been tampered with? In today's digital world, document security isn't just nice to have—it's essential. Whether you're handling contracts, legal agreements, or sensitive records, you need reliable methods to verify document integrity.

That's where image metadata signatures come in, and GroupDocs.Signature for .NET makes the whole process incredibly straightforward. In this guide, we'll walk you through searching for image metadata signatures step by step, with code examples you can implement right away.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. GroupDocs.Signature Installation - Have you installed the GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library in your development environment? If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).

2. Sample Documents - Get your hands on some test documents that contain image metadata signatures.

3. C# Basics - A fundamental understanding of C# will help you follow along with our code examples.

## Import the Required Namespaces

Let's start by including the necessary namespaces in your C# project to access all GroupDocs.Signature features:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```

## Step 1: Specify Your Document Path

First, we need to tell the program where your document is located:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample.png";
```

Feel free to replace "sample.png" with the path to your own document.

## Step 2: Create a Signature Object

Now, let's initialize a Signature object by providing the file path:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // We'll add our search code here in the next step
}
```

The using statement ensures that resources are properly disposed of when we're done.

## Step 3: Search for Image Metadata Signatures

Here's where the magic happens. We'll search for all image metadata signatures in the document:

```csharp
List<ImageMetadataSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageMetadataSignature>(SignatureType.Metadata);
```

This single line of code does all the heavy lifting, searching through your document and finding any image metadata signatures.

## Step 4: Display What You've Found

Let's show the results of our search:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains following signatures.");
foreach (ImageMetadataSignature mdSignature in signatures)
{
    // Display only added signatures (IDs above 41995 are custom signatures)
    if (mdSignature.Id > 41995)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\t[{mdSignature.Id}] = {mdSignature.Value} ({mdSignature.Type})");
    }
}
```

This code loops through all found signatures and displays their ID, value, and type—giving you a complete picture of the metadata signatures in your document.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to search for image metadata signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET! This powerful functionality helps you ensure document authenticity and integrity with minimal coding effort.
