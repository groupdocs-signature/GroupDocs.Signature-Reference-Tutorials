# Search Image Metadata Extraction with GroupDocs.Signature

## Introduction
In the digital age, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of documents is paramount. Whether it's contracts, legal agreements, or important records, having a reliable method to sign and verify documents is crucial. GroupDocs.Signature for .NET provides a comprehensive solution for adding and verifying signatures in various document formats. In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of searching for image metadata signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. 
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation: Ensure you have GroupDocs.Signature for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
2. Access to Sample Data: Have access to sample documents containing image metadata signatures for testing purposes.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial for understanding the code examples.

## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, include the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Signature functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
```
## Step 1: Define File Path
Firstly, define the file path of the document containing image metadata signatures:
```csharp
string filePath = "sample.png";
```
## Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Initialize a Signature object by providing the file path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code for signature operations will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Search for Signatures
Search for image metadata signatures within the document:
```csharp
List<ImageMetadataSignature> signatures = signature.Search<ImageMetadataSignature>(SignatureType.Metadata);
```
## Step 4: Display Results
Display the detected image metadata signatures:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document ['{filePath}'] contains following signatures.");
foreach (ImageMetadataSignature mdSignature in signatures)
{
    // Display only added signatures
    if (mdSignature.Id > 41995)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\t[{mdSignature.Id}] = {mdSignature.Value} ({mdSignature.Type})");
    }
}
```
