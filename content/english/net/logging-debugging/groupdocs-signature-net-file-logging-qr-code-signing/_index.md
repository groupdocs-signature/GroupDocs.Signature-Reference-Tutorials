# Document Signing .NET Tutorial: QR Codes & File Logging Made Simple

## Why Document Signing Matters (And Why Most Developers Get It Wrong)

Let's be honest - document signing in .NET can feel like navigating a minefield. You've got security concerns, compliance requirements, and the dreaded "it works on my machine" syndrome when dealing with different file formats.

Here's the thing: **most developers overcomplicate document signing**. They either build everything from scratch (reinventing the wheel), or they skimp on logging and error handling (leading to production nightmares).

This tutorial shows you the smart way: using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to implement rock-solid document signing with QR codes, complete with comprehensive file logging. You'll learn not just the "how," but the "why" behind each decision.

## What You'll Master in This Guide

By the end of this tutorial, you'll confidently:
- Set up GroupDocs.Signature for production use
- Implement bulletproof file logging for password-protected documents  
- Add QR code signatures that actually work in real scenarios
- Handle the edge cases that break other implementations
- Optimize performance for high-volume document processing

## Prerequisites (The Non-Negotiables)

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- **Required Libraries**: GroupDocs.Signature for .NET (latest version recommended)
- **Environment**: .NET Core 3.1+ or .NET Framework 4.6.1+
- **Knowledge Level**: Basic C# familiarity (you should understand using statements and try-catch blocks)
- **Optional But Helpful**: Experience with file I/O operations in .NET

**Pro Tip**: If you're working in a corporate environment, check if your organization already has a GroupDocs license. Many enterprises have site-wide agreements.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature (The Right Way)

### Installation Options

Choose the method that fits your workflow:

**.NET CLI (Recommended for most projects)**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest stable version.

### License Setup (Don't Skip This!)

Here's where many tutorials fall short. You need to handle licensing properly:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// For production - load from config
var signature = new Signature("your-file-path");
```

**License Options Explained**:
- **Free Trial**: Great for POCs, includes watermarks
- **Temporary License**: Perfect for extended testing (no watermarks)
- **Full License**: Production-ready, contact sales for enterprise pricing

## Core Implementation: File Logging + QR Code Signing

Let's build this step-by-step. I'll explain not just what each piece does, but *why* it's necessary.

### Part 1: Smart File Logging Setup

File logging isn't just about debugging - it's your insurance policy when things go wrong in production.

#### Step 1: Configure Load Options (Handle Password Protection)

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions()
{
    Password = "12345678901" // Example of incorrect password
};
```

**Why This Matters**: Real-world documents often come password-protected. This configuration lets you handle them gracefully instead of throwing unhandled exceptions.

**Common Gotcha**: Don't hardcode passwords in production! Load them from secure configuration or environment variables.

#### Step 2: Initialize FileLogger

```csharp
var logger = new FileLogger(outputLogFile);
```

**The Smart Approach**: Create your log file path dynamically:
```csharp
string logPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData), 
                              "YourApp", "Logs", $"signature-log-{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}.log");
var logger = new FileLogger(logPath);
```

This keeps logs organized and prevents disk space issues.

#### Step 3: Configure Signature Settings (Get The Right Amount of Detail)

```csharp
var settings = new SignatureSettings(logger)
{
    LogLevel = LogLevel.Trace | LogLevel.Error
};
```

**Log Level Strategy**:
- **Development**: Use `LogLevel.Trace` for everything
- **Production**: Stick to `LogLevel.Error | LogLevel.Warning`
- **Troubleshooting**: Temporarily enable `LogLevel.Debug`

#### Step 4: Execute Signing with Proper Error Handling

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions, settings))
    {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100
        };

        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log or handle exceptions as needed
}
```

**Why The Try-Catch Matters**: Document signing can fail for dozens of reasons - corrupted files, insufficient permissions, network issues (for cloud storage), etc. Always wrap your signing operations.

### Part 2: QR Code Signing That Actually Works

QR codes aren't just trendy - they're practical. Users can quickly verify document authenticity with any smartphone.

#### Step 1: Smart QR Code Configuration

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```

**Positioning Strategy**: Don't just plop the QR code anywhere. Consider:
- Document layout (avoid covering important text)
- Print friendliness (QR codes need sufficient contrast)
- Size constraints (too small = unreadable, too large = intrusive)

#### Step 2: Execute The Signing

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log or handle exceptions as needed
}
```

**Resource Management**: Notice the `using` statement? GroupDocs.Signature works with unmanaged resources. Always dispose properly to avoid memory leaks.

## Real-World Applications (When to Use This Approach)

### Perfect Use Cases:
- **Legal Document Processing**: Contracts, agreements, NDAs
- **Invoice Management**: B2B invoicing systems with verification needs
- **Educational Certificates**: Diplomas, training certifications
- **Healthcare Records**: Patient documents requiring HIPAA compliance
- **Financial Reports**: Audited statements, compliance documents

### Integration Scenarios:
- **Document Management Systems**: Add signing capabilities to existing workflows
- **API Services**: Expose signing functionality via REST endpoints
- **Batch Processing**: Handle hundreds of documents overnight
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Sign documents directly in SharePoint, Google Drive, etc.

## Common Issues & Solutions (Learn From Others' Mistakes)

### Problem 1: "File is Already in Use" Errors
**Cause**: Multiple processes trying to access the same file
**Solution**: Implement file locking and retry logic

### Problem 2: QR Codes Not Scanning Properly
**Cause**: Insufficient contrast, wrong size, or poor positioning
**Solution**: Test with multiple QR code readers, adjust size/position

### Problem 3: Memory Issues with Large Documents
**Cause**: Loading entire files into memory
**Solution**: Use streaming operations where possible, implement proper disposal patterns

### Problem 4: Logging Files Growing Too Large
**Cause**: Excessive trace logging in production
**Solution**: Implement log rotation and appropriate log levels

## Performance Optimization (Make It Production-Ready)

### Memory Management Best Practices

```csharp
// Good: Explicit disposal
using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Your signing logic here
} // Automatically disposed here

// Bad: Relying on garbage collection
var signature = new Signature(filePath);
signature.Sign(outputPath, options);
// Memory leak potential!
```

### Batch Processing Tips
- Process documents in smaller chunks (50-100 at a time)
- Implement parallel processing carefully (watch memory usage)
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Production Performance Guidelines
- **CPU Usage**: Document signing is CPU-intensive - plan accordingly
- **Memory**: Expect 2-5x file size in memory usage during processing
- **Disk I/O**: Temporary files are created during signing - ensure adequate disk space

## Pro Tips for Advanced Usage

### Custom QR Code Content
Instead of just names, encode structured data:
```csharp
var qrContent = $"{{\"signer\":\"{signerName}\",\"timestamp\":\"{DateTime.UtcNow:o}\",\"document_hash\":\"{documentHash}\"}}";
```

### Conditional Logging
Adjust log levels based on environment:
```csharp
var logLevel = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT") == "Production" 
    ? LogLevel.Error 
    : LogLevel.Trace;
```

### Signature Validation
Always verify signatures after creation:
```csharp
var searchOptions = new QrCodeSearchOptions();
var signatures = signature.Search(searchOptions);
// Validate the signature was applied correctly
```

## When NOT to Use This Approach

Be honest about limitations:
- **High-Security Scenarios**: Consider hardware security modules (HSMs) for maximum security
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Some industries require specific signature standards (eIDAS, FIPS)
- **Legacy Systems**: Very old .NET Framework versions might have compatibility issues

## Troubleshooting Checklist

When things go wrong, check these first:

1. **File Permissions**: Can your application read/write the target files?
2. **License Status**: Is your GroupDocs license valid and properly configured?
3. **File Format Support**: Does GroupDocs.Signature support your specific file type?
4. **Memory Availability**: Large documents need significant memory
5. **Network Connectivity**: Cloud storage integrations require stable connections
