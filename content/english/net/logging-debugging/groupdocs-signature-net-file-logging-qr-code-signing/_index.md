# File Logging & QR Code Signing: A Complete Guide Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, securing documents and ensuring their integrity is crucial. Whether it's protecting sensitive business information or verifying authenticity, signing documents is a key step. Managing and logging these processes can be complex. This guide will help you implement file logging and QR code signing using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, improving your document management workflow.

### What You'll Learn

- Set up and use GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Implement file logging for password-protected documents
- Sign documents with a QR code
- Optimize performance and manage resources effectively

Let's start by covering the prerequisites needed to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Required Libraries**: Install the latest version of GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
- **Environment Setup**: A basic understanding of C# and .NET environments is assumed.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with file handling in .NET will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

### Installation

To start, install the GroupDocs.Signature library using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

You can acquire a license through:

- **Free Trial**: Test the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Apply for an extended testing period.
- **Purchase**: Buy a full license for production use.

### Basic Initialization

Hereâ€™s how to initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

var signature = new Signature("your-file-path");
```

## Implementation Guide

This section is divided into two main features: File Logging and QR Code Signing.

### Feature 1: File Logging

#### Overview

File logging helps track the signing process, especially for password-protected documents. It provides insights into operations and errors, aiding in troubleshooting.

##### Step 1: Configure Load Options

Start by setting up load options to handle password protection:

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions()
{
    Password = "12345678901" // Example of incorrect password
};
```

**Explanation**: This step ensures the document can be accessed, even if initially protected.

##### Step 2: Initialize FileLogger

Set up a logger to capture log data:

```csharp
var logger = new FileLogger(outputLogFile);
```

**Explanation**: The `FileLogger` writes logs to a specified file, aiding in monitoring and debugging.

##### Step 3: Configure SignatureSettings

Customize logging levels for detailed insights:

```csharp
var settings = new SignatureSettings(logger)
{
    LogLevel = LogLevel.Trace | LogLevel.Error
};
```

**Explanation**: Adjusting log levels helps filter the information you need.

##### Step 4: Sign the Document

Implement the signing process with error handling:

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions, settings))
    {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100
        };

        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log or handle exceptions as needed
}
```

**Explanation**: This step executes the signing operation and handles potential errors gracefully.

### Feature 2: QR Code Signing

#### Overview

QR code signing adds a layer of verification to your documents, making them easily scannable and verifiable.

##### Step 1: Set Up Sign Options

Define the QR code sign options:

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```

**Explanation**: This configures the QR code's appearance and placement on the document.

##### Step 2: Sign the Document

Execute the signing process:

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log or handle exceptions as needed
}
```

**Explanation**: This step applies the QR code to your document and manages any errors.

## Practical Applications

- **Legal Contracts**: Ensure authenticity with QR codes.
- **Invoice Management**: Streamline verification processes.
- **Educational Certificates**: Securely sign documents for students.
- **Corporate Reports**: Enhance document integrity.
- **Healthcare Records**: Protect sensitive information.

Integration possibilities include linking with CRM systems or cloud storage solutions for enhanced accessibility and security.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance

- Use efficient data structures to manage large files.
- Minimize logging verbosity in production environments.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks.

### Resource Usage Guidelines

- Monitor memory usage, especially when handling multiple documents simultaneously.
- Dispose of resources promptly using `using` statements.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management

- Implement proper exception handling to prevent resource leaks.
- Regularly update the GroupDocs.Signature library for performance improvements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we explored how to implement file logging and QR code signing with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. These features enhance document security and integrity, providing a robust solution for various applications.

### Next Steps
