# Implement Custom Logging in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Are you facing challenges tracking errors and events during the document signing process using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET? This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up custom logging, a powerful feature that enhances visibility into your application's signature processes. By integrating both console and API-based logging solutions, you'll capture detailed logs efficiently.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Implementing custom logging in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Steps to sign password-protected documents with enhanced logging features
- Setting up an API logger that sends log messages to a specified endpoint

Ready to unlock better debugging and monitoring capabilities? Let's get started by first understanding the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into custom logging, ensure you have the following in place:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: This library must be integrated into your project. It provides robust functionality for document signing and supports various signature types like QR codes.
- **System.Net.Http**: Essential for implementing API-based logging.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A .NET development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Access to an API endpoint if you plan on using the custom API logger feature.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# and the .NET framework.
- Familiarity with exception handling in .NET.

With these prerequisites covered, let's proceed to set up GroupDocs.Signature for your project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Signature, you need to install it via one of the package managers. Here are the steps:

### Installation Options

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Open the NuGet Package Manager in your IDE.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Signature, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial version to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full-feature testing.
- **Purchase**: Acquire a commercial license for production environments.

### Basic Initialization

Here's how to initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your .NET application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Create an instance of the Signature class
signature = new Signature("sample.pdf");
```

This setup forms the foundation upon which we'll build our custom logging features.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's delve into implementing custom logging. We’ll explore two key features: console-based and API-based logging.

### Custom Logging for Signature Process

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to sign a password-protected document while capturing logs using the `ConsoleLogger`.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Define Paths and Load Options**
Start by setting up file paths and incorrect passwords for demonstration purposes:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.pdf"; // Replace with your actual document path
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions() { Password = "12345678901" };
```

**Initialize the Custom Logger**
Create an instance of `ConsoleLogger` and configure logging settings:

```csharp
var logger = new ConsoleLogger();
var settings = new SignatureSettings(logger);
settings.LogLevel = LogLevel.Warning | LogLevel.Error;
```

**Sign the Document**
Use GroupDocs.Signature to sign your document with custom logging enabled:

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions, settings))
    {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100
        };

        signature.Sign("outputPath", options);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    logger.Error("Signing process failed.", ex);
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure the file paths are correctly set and accessible.
- Validate that your document password is accurate if not intended for demonstration.

### Custom API Logger

#### Overview
This feature sends log messages to a specified API endpoint, allowing centralized logging management.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Set Up HttpClient**
Initialize an `HttpClient` with necessary headers:

```csharp
class APILogger : ILogger
{
    private object _lock = new object();
    private HttpClient _client;

    public APILogger()
    {
        _client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:64195/") };
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
    }
}
```

**Implement Logging Methods**
Define methods to log errors, traces, and warnings:

```csharp
public void Error(string message, Exception exception)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message) || exception == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(message == null ? nameof(message) : nameof(exception));
    PostMessage(LogLevel.Error, $"{message}. Exception: {exception}");
}

private string PostMessage(LogLevel level, string message)
{
    var hdrs = level switch
    {
        LogLevel.Warning => "WARNING",
        LogLevel.Error => "ERROR",
        _ => "INFO"
    };

    var date = DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm tt");
    var line = $"GroupDocs.Signature {hdrs} [{date}]. Message: {message}";
    var content = new StringContent(line);

    lock (_lock)
    {
        var response = _client.PostAsync("api/logging", content).Result;
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
    }
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure your API endpoint is reachable and correctly configured.
- Verify network connectivity if encountering HTTP request issues.

## Practical Applications

### Use Cases for Custom Logging with GroupDocs.Signature
1. **Document Management Systems**: Track signature processes in enterprise document workflows.
2. **Legal Document Automation**: Monitor signing events to ensure compliance and integrity.
3. **E-commerce Platforms**: Log customer agreements during checkout processes.
4. **Educational Institutions**: Record consent forms or student admissions electronically.
5. **Healthcare Providers**: Securely manage patient record consents with detailed logging.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Use appropriate log levels to avoid excessive logging that may impact performance.
- Ensure efficient resource management by properly disposing of `Signature` and `HttpClient` instances.
- Monitor application memory usage when handling large documents or numerous signing operations.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
- Utilize `using` statements to automatically dispose of unmanaged resources.
- Implement asynchronous logging where possible to avoid blocking main thread execution.

## Conclusion

By implementing custom logging in GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you can significantly enhance your application's robustness and maintainability. This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge to integrate both console and API-based logging features into your signature processes.
