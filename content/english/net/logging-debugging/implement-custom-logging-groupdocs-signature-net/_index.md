# GroupDocs.Signature Custom Logging .NET

## Introduction

Ever found yourself staring at a failed document signing process with no clue what went wrong? You're not alone. When you're working with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET in production, things can go sideways fast—password protection issues, network timeouts, corrupted documents—and without proper logging, you're basically debugging blindfolded.

That's where custom logging comes to the rescue. Instead of relying on basic error messages (or worse, silent failures), you can capture detailed information about every step of your signature process. Whether you need simple console output for development or sophisticated API-based logging for production monitoring, this guide has you covered.

**What you'll walk away with:**
- A rock-solid custom logging setup for GroupDocs.Signature
- Both console and API-based logging implementations (with real code you can copy-paste)
- Troubleshooting techniques that'll save you hours of debugging
- Performance tips to keep your logging efficient

Ready to never lose another signing error in the void? Let's dive in.

## Why Custom Logging Matters for Document Signing

Before we jump into the code, let's talk about why this matters. GroupDocs.Signature handles some pretty complex operations—document parsing, signature validation, encryption handling. When something breaks (and it will), you need visibility into:

- **Authentication failures** with password-protected documents
- **Network issues** when working with remote documents
- **Memory problems** with large document processing
- **Signature validation errors** that could indicate tampering
- **Performance bottlenecks** in batch processing scenarios

Without proper logging, these issues become time-consuming mysteries. With it, you can spot patterns, identify root causes, and even prevent problems before they impact users.

## Prerequisites and Setup

### What You'll Need

Before we start implementing custom logging, make sure you've got these bases covered:

**Required Libraries:**
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET** - The main library (obviously)
- **System.Net.Http** - For API-based logging features
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1+** or **.NET Core 2.0+**

**Development Environment:**
- Visual Studio 2019+ (or your preferred IDE)
- Access to an API endpoint (if using API logging)
- Sample documents for testing (PDF, Word, Excel—whatever you're working with)

### Installing GroupDocs.Signature

If you haven't already set this up, here's the quickest way to get GroupDocs.Signature into your project:

**.NET CLI** (my personal favorite):
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console**:
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet UI**: Just search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and hit install.

### License Setup

Here's the deal with licensing—you can start with the free trial to test everything out, but you'll need a proper license for production use. You can grab a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for extended testing or dive straight into a [commercial license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) if you're ready to roll.

### Basic Initialization

Once you've got the package installed, here's how you initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Basic setup - this is your starting point
using var signature = new Signature("your-document.pdf");
```

Pretty straightforward, right? Now let's add some serious logging capabilities to this.

## Implementing Console-Based Custom Logging

### Why Start with Console Logging?

Console logging is perfect for development and debugging scenarios. It's immediate, easy to implement, and gives you real-time feedback without additional infrastructure. Plus, it's a great stepping stone before implementing more complex logging solutions.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's build a complete example that signs a password-protected document while capturing detailed logs. I'm using an intentionally incorrect password here so you can see how the logging handles errors:

**1. Set Up Your Document and Options**

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.pdf"; // Replace with your actual document path
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions() { Password = "12345678901" }; // Intentionally wrong password for demo
```

**2. Configure the Custom Logger**

Here's where the magic happens. We're creating a `ConsoleLogger` instance and configuring it to capture warnings and errors:

```csharp
var logger = new ConsoleLogger();
var settings = new SignatureSettings(logger);
settings.LogLevel = LogLevel.Warning | LogLevel.Error;
```

**Pro tip**: You can adjust `LogLevel` based on how much information you need. For development, I often use `LogLevel.All` to see everything. For production, stick to warnings and errors to avoid log bloat.

**3. Implement the Signing Process**

```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions, settings))
    {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100
        };

        signature.Sign("outputPath", options);
        logger.Trace("Document signed successfully");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    logger.Error("Signing process failed.", ex);
}
```

### What You'll See in Action

When you run this code, you'll get detailed console output showing exactly what's happening during the signing process. With the incorrect password, you'll see authentication errors logged clearly, making it obvious what needs to be fixed.

### Common Console Logging Scenarios

**Development debugging**: Set `LogLevel.All` to see every operation
**Integration testing**: Use `LogLevel.Warning | LogLevel.Error` to catch issues without noise
**Demo scenarios**: Perfect for showing clients how robust your error handling is

## Building an API-Based Custom Logger

### When to Use API Logging

Console logging is great for development, but in production, you need something more sophisticated. API-based logging allows you to:
- Centralize logs from multiple application instances
- Integrate with monitoring systems like ELK stack or Azure Application Insights
- Set up alerts based on error patterns
- Maintain log history for compliance requirements

### Complete API Logger Implementation

Here's a production-ready API logger that sends structured log data to your logging endpoint:

**1. Set Up the Base Logger Class**

```csharp
class APILogger : ILogger
{
    private object _lock = new object();
    private HttpClient _client;

    public APILogger()
    {
        _client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:64195/") };
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
    }
}
```

**2. Implement the Core Logging Methods**

```csharp
public void Error(string message, Exception exception)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message) || exception == null) 
        throw new ArgumentNullException(message == null ? nameof(message) : nameof(exception));
    
    PostMessage(LogLevel.Error, $"{message}. Exception: {exception}");
}

public void Warning(string message)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message)) 
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(message));
    
    PostMessage(LogLevel.Warning, message);
}

public void Trace(string message)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message)) 
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(message));
    
    PostMessage(LogLevel.Trace, message);
}
```

**3. Handle the HTTP Communication**

```csharp
private string PostMessage(LogLevel level, string message)
{
    var hdrs = level switch
    {
        LogLevel.Warning => "WARNING",
        LogLevel.Error => "ERROR",
        _ => "INFO"
    };

    var date = DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm tt");
    var line = $"GroupDocs.Signature {hdrs} [{date}]. Message: {message}";
    var content = new StringContent(line);

    lock (_lock)
    {
        try
        {
            var response = _client.PostAsync("api/logging", content).Result;
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException httpEx)
        {
            // Fallback to console if API is unavailable
            Console.WriteLine($"API logging failed: {httpEx.Message}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Original log: {line}");
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

### API Logger Best Practices

**Thread Safety**: Notice the `_lock` object? That's crucial when multiple threads might be logging simultaneously.

**Graceful Degradation**: The try-catch in `PostMessage` ensures your application doesn't crash if your logging API is down.

**Structured Data**: Consider sending JSON instead of plain text for better parsing on the receiving end.

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

### Where This Really Shines

Let me share some scenarios where I've seen custom logging make a huge difference:

**Enterprise Document Management**: A client was processing thousands of contracts daily. Without logging, they'd occasionally lose documents in processing with no trace. Custom logging revealed memory issues during peak hours and network timeouts with specific document types.

**Legal Document Automation**: Law firms need audit trails for compliance. API-based logging provided timestamped records of every signature attempt, including failed authentications and document modifications.

**E-commerce Platforms**: Online stores using digital signatures for terms of service needed to prove customer consent. Detailed logging helped them track the entire consent flow and troubleshoot checkout failures.

**Healthcare Systems**: HIPAA compliance requires detailed audit logs. Custom logging captured every access attempt and signature validation, making compliance audits straightforward.

### Industry-Specific Considerations

**Financial Services**: Focus on security events and failed authentication attempts
**Healthcare**: Emphasize audit trails and access logging
**Legal**: Prioritize document integrity and signature validation logs
**Education**: Track consent forms and student record access

## Performance Considerations and Best Practices

### Keeping Your Logging Efficient

Logging can become a performance bottleneck if you're not careful. Here are some hard-learned lessons:

**1. Choose the Right Log Level**
```csharp
// Development - see everything
settings.LogLevel = LogLevel.All;

// Production - focus on problems
settings.LogLevel = LogLevel.Warning | LogLevel.Error;

// High-traffic production - errors only
settings.LogLevel = LogLevel.Error;
```

**2. Implement Async Logging for High-Volume Scenarios**

For applications processing hundreds of documents per minute, synchronous logging can create bottlenecks. Consider implementing async logging:

```csharp
private async Task PostMessageAsync(LogLevel level, string message)
{
    // Async implementation for high-volume scenarios
    var response = await _client.PostAsync("api/logging", content);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

**3. Resource Management**

Always properly dispose of resources, especially `HttpClient` instances:

```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    _client?.Dispose();
}
```

**4. Memory Management for Large Documents**

When processing large documents, monitor your memory usage:
- Use `using` statements for automatic resource disposal
- Process documents in batches rather than loading everything into memory
- Consider streaming for very large files

### Monitoring Your Logging Performance

Set up metrics to track:
- Log message processing time
- API response times for remote logging
- Memory usage during document processing
- Failed logging attempts

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Issues You're Likely to Encounter

**"My logs aren't appearing"**
- Check your log level settings—you might be filtering out the messages you want
- Verify file paths and permissions for file-based logging
- Ensure your API endpoint is reachable and responding correctly

**"Logging is slowing down my application"**
- Switch to async logging for high-volume scenarios
- Reduce log verbosity in production
- Check for network latency if using API logging

**"Getting null reference exceptions"**
- Always validate input parameters in your logging methods
- Implement proper error handling in your HTTP communications
- Use defensive coding practices

### Advanced Troubleshooting Scenarios

**Memory leaks during batch processing**: This usually happens when you're not properly disposing of `Signature` objects. Always use `using` statements or call `Dispose()` explicitly.

**Network timeouts with API logging**: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms. If your logging API is down, your document processing shouldn't stop.

**Log message truncation**: Some logging systems have message size limits. Consider summarizing exception details or splitting large messages.

## Conclusion

Custom logging in GroupDocs.Signature isn't just about debugging—it's about building robust, maintainable applications that you can actually support in production. Whether you're starting with simple console logging or implementing sophisticated API-based monitoring, the techniques in this guide will help you catch issues before they become problems.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use multiple loggers simultaneously?
Absolutely! You can implement a composite logger that writes to both console and API endpoints. This is particularly useful during development when you want immediate console feedback and persistent API logs.

### Q: How much does logging impact performance?
With proper implementation, the performance impact should be minimal (< 5%). The key is using appropriate log levels and async logging for high-volume scenarios.

### Q: What's the best way to handle logging in a multi-threaded environment?
Use thread-safe logging implementations. The `APILogger` example above uses a lock for thread safety, but consider using concurrent collections for better performance in highly concurrent scenarios.

### Q: How should I secure my API logging endpoint?
Implement authentication (API keys, JWT tokens), use HTTPS, and consider rate limiting to prevent log flooding attacks. Never log sensitive data like passwords or personal information.

### Q: Can I integrate this with existing logging frameworks like NLog or Serilog?
Yes! You can create adapters that bridge GroupDocs.Signature's `ILogger` interface with your preferred logging framework. This gives you the best of both worlds.
