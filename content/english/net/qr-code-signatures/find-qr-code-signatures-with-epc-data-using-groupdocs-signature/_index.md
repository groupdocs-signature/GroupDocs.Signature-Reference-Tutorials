## Core Implementation: Finding QR Code Signatures

Let's start with a practical example that demonstrates the core functionality. This code searches a PDF document for QR codes containing payment information:

### Basic Setup and Initialization

First, initialize the GroupDocs.Signature library in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

public class QRCodeSearchExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Point to your document - this could be PDF, Word, Excel, or image formats
        string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF_QRCODE_EPC_OBJECT";
        
        using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            // Your QR code search logic goes here
            SearchForQRCodes(signature);
        }
    }
}
```

**Pro Tip**: The `using` statement automatically disposes of resources, preventing memory leaks in long-running applications. Always wrap your `Signature` instances this way.

### Implementing QR Code Search

Here's where the magic happens. This method searches your document and extracts structured data from any QR codes it finds:

```csharp
private static void SearchForQRCodes(Signature signature)
{
    try
    {
        // Search for all QR code signatures in the document
        List<QrCodeSignature> signatures = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(SignatureType.QrCode);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Found {signatures.Count} QR code signatures in the document");
        
        // Process each QR code signature
        foreach (QrCodeSignature qrSignature in signatures)
        {
            ProcessQRCodeSignature(qrSignature);
        }
    }
    catch (GroupDocsSignatureException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Signature processing error: {ex.Message}");
        // Log the error for debugging - common with trial licenses
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Extracting Structured Data from QR Codes

This is where things get interesting. Many QR codes contain structured data like payment information, product details, or custom metadata:

```csharp
private static void ProcessQRCodeSignature(QrCodeSignature qrSignature)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Processing QR Code: {qrSignature.EncodeType.TypeName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Position: X={qrSignature.Left}, Y={qrSignature.Top}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Size: {qrSignature.Width}x{qrSignature.Height}");
    
    // Attempt to extract EPC (Electronic Payment Code) data
    // This is commonly used in European banking for QR payments
    EPC paymentData = qrSignature.GetData<EPC>();
    
    if (paymentData != null)
    {
        // Successfully extracted payment information
        Console.WriteLine("ðŸŽ‰ Payment QR Code Found!");
        Console.WriteLine($"Recipient: {paymentData.Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"IBAN: {paymentData.IBAN}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Amount: {paymentData.Amount:C}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Reference: {paymentData.Reference}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Remittance Info: {paymentData.Remittance}");
    }
    else
    {
        // QR code doesn't contain EPC data - might be plain text or other format
        Console.WriteLine($"Plain text QR code: {qrSignature.Text}");
        
        // You could implement custom parsers here for other data formats
        // For example: product codes, URLs, contact information, etc.
    }
    
    Console.WriteLine("---");
}
```

### Handling Different QR Code Types

Real-world documents contain various QR code formats. Here's how to handle the most common ones:

```csharp
private static void ProcessQRCodeSignature(QrCodeSignature qrSignature)
{
    // Check what type of QR code we're dealing with
    string qrText = qrSignature.Text;
    
    if (qrText.StartsWith("BCD")) // EPC/SEPA payment format
    {
        EPC paymentData = qrSignature.GetData<EPC>();
        if (paymentData != null)
        {
            ProcessPaymentQR(paymentData);
        }
    }
    else if (qrText.StartsWith("http")) // URL QR codes
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found URL QR code: {qrText}");
        // Could validate URLs, check domains, etc.
    }
    else if (qrText.Contains("@")) // Possible email or contact info
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found contact QR code: {qrText}");
        // Could extract email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found generic QR code: {qrText}");
        // Handle custom formats specific to your business
    }
}
```

## Advanced Search Techniques

### Filtering QR Codes by Content

Sometimes you only want to find QR codes containing specific information. Here's how to implement smart filtering:

```csharp
public static List<QrCodeSignature> FindPaymentQRCodes(Signature signature)
{
    var allQRCodes = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(SignatureType.QrCode);
    var paymentQRCodes = new List<QrCodeSignature>();
    
    foreach (var qr in allQRCodes)
    {
        // Look for EPC payment indicators
        if (qr.Text.StartsWith("BCD") || qr.GetData<EPC>() != null)
        {
            paymentQRCodes.Add(qr);
        }
    }
    
    return paymentQRCodes;
}
```

### Batch Processing Multiple Documents

For production scenarios, you'll often need to process multiple documents. Here's an efficient approach:

```csharp
public static void ProcessDocumentBatch(string[] filePaths)
{
    foreach (string filePath in filePaths)
    {
        try
        {
            using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
            {
                var qrCodes = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(SignatureType.QrCode);
                Console.WriteLine($"{Path.GetFileName(filePath)}: Found {qrCodes.Count} QR codes");
                
                // Process each QR code...
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error processing {filePath}: {ex.Message}");
            // Continue with next document rather than failing entire batch
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Production Use

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Management**: Always dispose of `Signature` objects properly to prevent memory leaks in long-running applications:

```csharp
// Good: Using 'using' statement
using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Process document
}

// Also good: Explicit disposal
var signature = new Signature(filePath);
try
{
    // Process document
}
finally
{
    signature.Dispose();
}
```

**Large Document Handling**: For very large documents or batch processing, consider implementing pagination or streaming approaches to manage memory usage.

**Caching**: If you're processing the same documents repeatedly, consider implementing a caching mechanism to store QR code locations and data.

### Error Handling and Logging

Robust error handling is crucial for production applications:

```csharp
public static class QRCodeProcessor
{
    private static readonly ILogger logger = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();
    
    public static ProcessingResult ProcessDocument(string filePath)
    {
        var result = new ProcessingResult { FilePath = filePath };
        
        try
        {
            using (var signature = new Signature(filePath))
            {
                result.QRCodes = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(SignatureType.QrCode);
                result.Success = true;
                
                logger.Info($"Successfully processed {filePath}: {result.QRCodes.Count} QR codes found");
            }
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException)
        {
            result.ErrorMessage = "Document file not found";
            logger.Error($"File not found: {filePath}");
        }
        catch (GroupDocsSignatureException ex)
        {
            result.ErrorMessage = $"Signature processing error: {ex.Message}";
            logger.Error(ex, $"GroupDocs error processing {filePath}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            result.ErrorMessage = $"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}";
            logger.Error(ex, $"Unexpected error processing {filePath}");
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Security Considerations

**Input Validation**: Always validate file paths and document types before processing:

```csharp
private static bool IsValidDocumentType(string filePath)
{
    string[] supportedExtensions = { ".pdf", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg" };
    string extension = Path.GetExtension(filePath).ToLower();
    return supportedExtensions.Contains(extension);
}
```

**Data Sanitization**: When extracting data from QR codes, always sanitize the output before using it in database queries or displaying to users.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### License-Related Problems

**"This example requires a license" Error**
- Ensure you've applied your license correctly before creating `Signature` instances
- For trial users, some features may have limitationsâ€”contact GroupDocs support for clarification

**Temporary License Expired**
- Request a new temporary license or purchase a full license
- Development teams often need site licenses for multiple developers

### Document Processing Issues

**"No QR Codes Found" in Documents That Clearly Have Them**
- Check if QR codes are actually signatures vs. regular images
- Verify the document format is supported (PDF, Word, Excel, images)
- Some scanned documents may need OCR preprocessing

**EPC Data Extraction Fails**
- Not all QR codes contain EPC dataâ€”verify the QR code format
- Check if the QR code follows proper EPC/SEPA standards
- Some custom QR codes may look like payment codes but use different formats

**Memory Issues with Large Documents**
- Implement streaming for very large files
- Process documents in batches rather than all at once
- Increase available memory for your application

### Performance Problems

**Slow Processing Speed**
- Consider processing only specific areas of documents if QR codes are in predictable locations
- Use async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks

**High Memory Usage**
- Ensure proper disposal of `Signature` objects
- Don't hold references to processed documents longer than necessary
- Consider implementing a document processing queue for high-volume scenarios

## Real-World Integration Example

Here's how you might integrate QR code signature search into a typical business application:

```csharp
public class InvoiceProcessor
{
    public async Task<ProcessingResult> ProcessInvoiceAsync(string invoicePath)
    {
        var result = new ProcessingResult();
        
        using (var signature = new Signature(invoicePath))
        {
            // Search for payment QR codes
            var qrCodes = signature.Search<QrCodeSignature>(SignatureType.QrCode);
            
            foreach (var qr in qrCodes)
            {
                var epcData = qr.GetData<EPC>();
                if (epcData != null)
                {
                    // Found payment information - validate and process
                    if (await ValidatePaymentDataAsync(epcData))
                    {
                        await CreatePaymentRecordAsync(epcData, invoicePath);
                        result.PaymentsProcessed++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private async Task<bool> ValidatePaymentDataAsync(EPC paymentData)
    {
        // Implement your business validation logic
        // Check IBAN format, amount limits, etc.
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(paymentData.IBAN) && paymentData.Amount > 0;
    }
    
    private async Task CreatePaymentRecordAsync(EPC paymentData, string sourceDocument)
    {
        // Create payment record in your system
        // Update invoice status
        // Trigger payment workflow
    }
}
```
