## Implementation Guide

Now that we have our environment set up, let's walk through the implementation process.

### Signing a PDF Document with QR Code

This feature allows you to embed a QR code in your PDF documents as a digital signature. Here’s how:

#### Step 1: Configuring QR Code Properties

Before signing the document, configure the properties of your QR code:

```csharp
// Create QR-Code options with predefined text
text = new QrCodeSignOptions("Signed by GroupDocs")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 200,
    Background = { Color = Color.Black, Transparency = 0.5 },
    Foreground = { Color = Color.White }
};
```

- **EncodeType**: Specifies the QR code format.
- **Left**, **Top**, **Width**, and **Height**: Define the position and size on the document.
- **Background** and **Foreground**: Customize colors and transparency.

#### Step 2: Signing the Document

Use the configured options to sign your PDF:

```csharp
// Sign the document with QR code
result = signature.Sign(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\Sample_Signed.pdf", qrCodeOptions);
```

- **SignResult** provides information about the signing process and can be used for further analysis.

#### Step 3: Analyzing the Result

After signing, verify the result to ensure successful execution:

```csharp
if (result.Succeeded)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document signed successfully.");
}
else
{
    foreach (var error in result.Errors)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error occurred: {error.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified.
- Check for permission issues with directories.
- Validate QR code properties to match document specifications.
