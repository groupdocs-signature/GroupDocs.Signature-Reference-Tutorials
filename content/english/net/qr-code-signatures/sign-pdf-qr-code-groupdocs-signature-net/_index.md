}
```

**Why use the `using` statement?** It automatically disposes of resources when done, preventing memory leaks in your application.

## Implementation Guide - Step by Step

Now for the exciting part – let's build the QR code signature functionality. We'll break this down into manageable steps.

### Understanding HIBC LIC Combined Data

Before jumping into code, let's understand what we're working with. HIBC (Health Industry Bar Code) is a standard used primarily in healthcare for product identification. The "LIC Combined Data" format allows you to embed rich product information in a structured way.

**When would you use this?**
- Medical device documentation
- Pharmaceutical product tracking  
- Healthcare compliance reporting
- Supply chain verification

### Creating the HIBC LIC Combined Data Object

First, we'll set up the data structure that will be embedded in our QR code:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Step 1: Create HIBC LIC Combined data object
class HIBCLICPrimaryData
{
    public string ProductOrCatalogNumber { get; set; }
}

class HIBCLICCombinedData : HIBCLICPrimaryData
{
    // Additional properties as needed
}

// Create the combined data object
class CombinedDataExample
{
    var combinedData = new HIBCLICCombinedData()
    {
        ProductOrCatalogNumber = "12345",
        // Populate other necessary fields here
    };
```

**Key Points:**
- `ProductOrCatalogNumber`: This is your unique product identifier
- The structure is extensible – add properties as your use case requires
- Keep data concise to ensure QR code readability

### Generating and Signing with QR Code

Now let's create the QR code and apply it to your PDF:

```csharp
// Step 2: Create QRCodeSignOptions
class SignOptionsExample
{
    var options = new QrCodeSignOptions(combinedData)
    {
        EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
        Left = 100,
        Top = 100,
        Width = 200,
        Height = 200,
    };

    // Step 3: Sign the document and save it
    signature.Sign("path/to/your/output/document.pdf", options);
}
```

**Understanding the Options:**
- **EncodeType**: QR is the standard format, but other types are available
- **Position (Left, Top)**: Coordinates where the QR code appears on the page
- **Size (Width, Height)**: Dimensions in pixels – larger codes are easier to scan but take more space

## Common Issues and Solutions

Even experienced developers run into hiccups. Here are the most common issues and how to solve them:

### File Path Problems
**Issue**: "File not found" errors
**Solution**: Always use absolute paths or verify relative paths are correct from your application's working directory

```csharp
// Instead of: "document.pdf"
// Use: Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "documents", "document.pdf")
```

### Data Format Issues
**Issue**: QR code generation fails with HIBC data
**Solution**: Ensure your data conforms to HIBC standards and doesn't exceed QR code capacity limits

### Memory Issues with Large Files
**Issue**: OutOfMemoryException with large PDFs
**Solution**: Process documents in smaller batches and ensure proper disposal of resources

### License Validation Errors
**Issue**: "Invalid license" messages
**Solution**: Verify license file placement and check expiration dates

## Performance Optimization Tips

Want your PDF signing process to run smoothly? Here are some performance considerations:

### Memory Management Best Practices
- Always use `using` statements for GroupDocs objects
- Process large document batches in smaller chunks
- Clear unused objects explicitly when processing many files

### Batch Processing Strategies
When signing multiple documents:
```csharp
// Process documents in batches of 10-20 for optimal performance
foreach (var batch in documents.Chunk(15))
{
    // Process each batch
    // Allow garbage collection between batches
    GC.Collect();
}
```

### QR Code Optimization
- Keep embedded data as compact as possible
- Use appropriate error correction levels
- Test QR code readability across different devices

## Practical Applications and Use Cases

This isn't just theoretical – here's how organizations are using QR code PDF signatures:

```csharp
var options = new QrCodeSignOptions(combinedData)
{
    // Basic positioning
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 200,
    
    // Advanced styling options
    Border = new Border() { Color = Color.Red, Width = 2 },
    Background = new Background() { Color = Color.LightGray },
    
    // Rotation and transparency
    RotationAngle = 45,
    Transparency = 0.8
};
```

### Multiple QR Codes on One Document
You can add multiple QR codes to a single document by calling `Sign` multiple times with different options.

### Conditional QR Code Placement
Determine QR code placement based on document content or metadata for optimal positioning.
