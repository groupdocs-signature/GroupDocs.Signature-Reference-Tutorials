# How to Sign a PDF Document with QR Code Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

Do you need a secure way to sign documents while ensuring they are easily verifiable and compliant with industry standards? Integrating QR codes containing complex data objects, such as HIBC LIC CombinedData, offers a seamless solution. This tutorial guides you through using **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET** to sign PDFs with QR codes embedding intricate HIBC LIC CombinedData objects.

By mastering this technique, enhance document security and traceability in sectors like healthcare and logistics where the HIBC standard is prevalent.

### What You'll Learn:
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- Creating a QR code that embeds an HIBC LIC CombinedData object
- Signing a PDF document with this QR code
- Best practices for workflow integration

Let's begin by ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Versions:
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: Use a compatible version. Check the [official documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/net/) for specific requirements.

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment with .NET installed (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework).
- Visual Studio or any IDE supporting C# and .NET projects.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming and .NET project setup.
- Familiarity with document signing and QR code generation is helpful but not mandatory.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Before diving into implementation, set up GroupDocs.Signature in your environment:

### Installation Methods:
**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial**: Explore functionalities with a free trial.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain an extended evaluation license [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a license from the [GroupDocs store](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Signature by creating an instance of the `Signature` class:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("path/to/your/document.pdf"))
{
    // Signing operations will be performed here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through creating and embedding a QR code with an HIBC LIC CombinedData object into your PDF document.

### Creating the HIBC LIC Combined Data Object

#### Overview:
Construct the `HIBCLICCombinedData` object encapsulating necessary information for compliance.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Step 1: Create HIBC LIC Combined data object
class HIBCLICPrimaryData
{
    public string ProductOrCatalogNumber { get; set; }
}

class HIBCLICCombinedData : HIBCLICPrimaryData
{
    // Additional properties as needed
}

// Create the combined data object
class CombinedDataExample
{
    var combinedData = new HIBCLICCombinedData()\n    {
        ProductOrCatalogNumber = "12345",
        // Populate other necessary fields here
    };
```

#### Explanation:
- `ProductOrCatalogNumber`: Unique identifier for the product or catalog.
- Customize additional properties as needed.

### Generating and Signing with QR Code

#### Overview:
Generate a QR code containing this data and use it to sign the document.

```csharp
// Step 2: Create QRCodeSignOptions
class SignOptionsExample
{
    var options = new QrCodeSignOptions(combinedData)
    {
        EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
        Left = 100,
        Top = 100,
        Width = 200,
        Height = 200,
    };

    // Step 3: Sign the document and save it
    signature.Sign("path/to/your/output/document.pdf", options);
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `EncodeType`: Specifies the QR code type. We're using standard QR codes here.
- Position (`Left`, `Top`) and size (`Width`, `Height`): Customize these values based on your layout preferences.

### Troubleshooting Tips
Common issues may include incorrect file paths or unsupported data formats in HIBC objects. Ensure all paths are correct and that the data complies with HIBC standards.

## Practical Applications
This method is not just theoretical; here are some real-world applications:
1. **Healthcare**: Securely sign medication records while ensuring compliance.
2. **Logistics**: Sign shipping documents with detailed tracking information embedded in QR codes.
3. **Retail**: Enhance product catalogs with verifiable and traceable data.

## Performance Considerations
When implementing this solution, consider the following to optimize performance:
- Use efficient memory management techniques inherent to .NET.
- Batch process documents to reduce overhead.
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Signature for optimizations in newer versions.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to sign PDF documents with QR codes using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This method enhances document security and ensures compliance with industry standards like HIBC.

### Next Steps:
- Experiment with different QR code options.
