        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Signature initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's sign an image and save it in a different format.

### Signing Images with QR Codes

#### Overview

This feature allows you to generate and append a QR code to any image. It can provide additional data like URLs or text, useful for authenticity verification or linking digital content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Load the Image**

First, load your image into GroupDocs.Signature:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\example.png";

// Initialize Signature instance
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Proceed with signing operations...
}
```

**Create a QR Code**

Define the QR code options:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

QrCodeSignOptions qrCodeOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("Your text or URL here")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 200
};
```

**Sign the Image**

Append the QR code to your image:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

signature.Sign("signedExample.png", qrCodeOptions);
Console.WriteLine("Image signed with QR Code.");
```

### Saving Signed Images in Different Formats

#### Overview

After signing, you might want to save the image in a different format for compatibility or preference reasons.

**Convert and Save**

You can convert the signed image like this:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Load the signed document
using (Signature signedSignature = new Signature("signedExample.png"))
{
    // Define save options to specify output format
    ImageSaveOptions saveOptions = new ImageSaveOptions(FileType.Jpg);

    // Save in specified format
    signedSignature.Save("convertedSignedImage.jpg", saveOptions);
    Console.WriteLine("Saved signed image as JPG.");
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**

- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the output directory has write permissions.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET can be used in various scenarios, such as:
