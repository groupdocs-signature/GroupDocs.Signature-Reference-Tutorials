Signature signature = new Signature(stream);
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's walk through the implementation steps.

### Feature 1: Load Document from FTP

#### Overview
This feature shows how to download and load documents from an FTP server for processing.

#### Downloading File from FTP Server
Establish a connection with your FTP server and download the document:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Net;

string filePath = "ftp://localhost/sample.doc";

// Function to create an FTP request and download a file as a stream.
private static Stream GetFileFromFtp(string filePath)
{
    Uri uri = new Uri(filePath);
    FtpWebRequest request = CreateRequest(uri);
    using (WebResponse response = request.GetResponse())
        return GetFileStream(response);
}

// Function to configure and create an FTP web request.
private static FtpWebRequest CreateRequest(Uri uri)
{
    FtpWebRequest request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(uri);
    request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DownloadFile;
    return request;
}

// Function to convert a web response into a memory stream.
private static Stream GetFileStream(WebResponse response)
{
    MemoryStream fileStream = new MemoryStream();
    using (Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
        responseStream.CopyTo(fileStream);
    fileStream.Position = 0;
    return fileStream;
}
```

### Feature 2: Sign Document with QR Code

#### Overview
Sign the downloaded document with a QR code, ensuring authenticity and easy verification.

#### Configuring QR Code Sign Options
Configure GroupDocs.Signature to generate and embed a QR code:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "signedSample.doc");

// Load the downloaded stream into the signature object.
using (Stream stream = GetFileFromFtp(filePath))
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(stream))
    {
        // Configure QR code sign options with necessary parameters.
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100, // Positioning on the document
            Top = 100
        };
        
        // Sign the document using the specified QR code sign options.
        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure FTP credentials and server URL are correct to avoid download errors.
- Verify GroupDocs.Signature is correctly initialized before signing documents.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios for this solution:
1. **Contract Management:** Automate contract signing with unique QR codes for authenticity and tracking.
2. **Invoice Processing:** Securely sign invoices to make them verifiable, reducing disputes.
3. **Internal Document Approval:** Facilitate approvals by embedding a QR code in reports or memos for identity verification.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance with GroupDocs.Signature:
- Use memory streams efficiently for large documents.
- Limit document processing to necessary pages if possible.
- Regularly update dependencies and libraries for improved speed and security.

## Conclusion
This tutorial has guided you through integrating GroupDocs.Signature into your .NET applications for secure QR code signing. This enhances document security and authenticity, benefiting various business processes.
