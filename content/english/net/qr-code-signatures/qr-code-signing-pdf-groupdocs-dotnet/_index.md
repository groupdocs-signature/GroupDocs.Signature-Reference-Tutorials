string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Signature for .NET is ready to use.");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: Signing PDFs with QR Code Positioning

This feature lets you sign PDF documents while precisely controlling the position of your QR code signatures using various alignment settings.

#### Step 1: Define Your Document and Output Paths

Specify paths for both the source PDF file and where the signed output will be saved:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"; // Replace with your document path
string fileName = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithAlignment", fileName);
```

#### Step 2: Configure QR Code Signature Options

Set the size and alignment options for your QR code signatures by iterating over different horizontal and vertical alignments:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Define QR-code size
int qrWidth = 100;
int qrHeight = 100;

List<SignOptions> listOptions = new List<SignOptions>();

foreach (HorizontalAlignment horizontalAlignment in Enum.GetValues(typeof(HorizontalAlignment)))
{
    foreach (VerticalAlignment verticalAlignment in Enum.GetValues(typeof(VerticalAlignment)))
    {
        if (verticalAlignment != VerticalAlignment.None && horizontalAlignment != HorizontalAlignment.None)
        {
            // Add QRCodeSignOptions with specified alignment and margin
            listOptions.Add(new QrCodeSignOptions("Left-Top")
            {
                Width = qrWidth,
                Height = qrHeight,
                HorizontalAlignment = horizontalAlignment,
                VerticalAlignment = verticalAlignment,
                Margin = new Padding(5)
            });
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Sign the Document

Use the defined options to sign your document and save it:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Sign the document using the specified options and save it to the output file path
    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, listOptions);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all necessary libraries are properly referenced in your project.
- Verify that paths for input and output files are correctly set.
- Check alignment settings if signatures do not appear as expected.
