// Create an instance of Signature class
signature = new Signature("Sample.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into sections for effective implementation.

### Sign Document with QR-Code Address

#### Overview

This feature allows you to sign a PDF document by embedding a QR code containing an address object, enhancing both security and information accessibility.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Create the Address Object

Define the address details for the QR code:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

// Define an address with necessary components
var address = new Address
{
    Street = "221B Baker Street",
    City = "London",
    State = "NW",
    ZIP = "NW16XE",
    Country = "England"
};
```

##### 2. Configure QRCodeSignOptions

Set up options for signing with a QR code:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Configure QR code sign options
var options = new QrCodeSignOptions
{
    EncodeType = GroupDocs.Signature.QrCodeTypes.QR, // Specify QR code type
    Data = address,                                // Assign the address to QR data
    HorizontalAlignment = GroupDocs.Signature.HorizontalAlignment.Left,
    VerticalAlignment = GroupDocs.Signature.VerticalAlignment.Center,
    Margin = new System.Drawing.Padding(10),
    Width = 100,
    Height = 100
};
```

##### 3. Sign the Document

Use the configured options to sign and save your document:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Specify paths for input and output documents
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedQRCodeAddressObject.pdf");

// Sign the PDF using the configured QR code options
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```
**Key Configuration Options:**
- `EncodeType`: Determines the type of QR code. Here, we use a standard QR.
- `Data`: The address object encoded into the QR code.
- `HorizontalAlignment` and `VerticalAlignment`: Control the placement of the QR code on the document.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Correct File Paths:** Double-check file paths to avoid errors related to missing files.
- **Verify Package Installation:** Ensure GroupDocs.Signature is correctly installed if issues arise.
- **Check Permissions:** Confirm your application has permissions to read and write documents in specified directories.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET can be used in various scenarios:
1. **Legal Document Signing:** Automate signing contracts with embedded QR codes containing party details.
2. **Corporate Agreements:** Enhance agreements by embedding contact information within a document.
3. **Event Registration Forms:** Securely store attendee information on registration forms using QR code addresses.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage with large documents.
- **Leverage Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous methods to improve application responsiveness where possible.
