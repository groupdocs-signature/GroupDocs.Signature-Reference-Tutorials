using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IMAGE";
        
        using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
        {
            // Initialize and configure the signature options here
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of signing an image document with a QR code into clear steps.

### Signing Image Documents with QR Code
This feature allows you to attach a QR-code-based digital signature, enhancing security and traceability.

#### Step 1: Define File Path
Specify the path to your image file:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IMAGE";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Create an instance of the `Signature` class for applying signatures:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Signing operations will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure QR Code Sign Options
Configure QR-code-specific settings, specifying encoding types and positioning on the image.

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```

#### Step 4: Apply Signature
Apply the configured QR code signature to your image document:

```csharp
signature.Sign("SignedOutput.jpg", signOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors:** Double-check paths for typos or incorrect directory structures.
- **Unsupported Formats:** Ensure that your image format is supported by GroupDocs.Signature.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where this feature can be useful:

1. **Document Authentication:** Use QR-code signatures to verify the authenticity of legal documents.
2. **Event Tickets:** Enhance security for digital event tickets with unique QR codes.
3. **Invoicing Systems:** Secure invoices and financial statements by embedding signature data in QR codes.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is key when working with large-scale document processing:
- **Efficient Resource Management:** Ensure proper disposal of resources using `using` statements to avoid memory leaks.
- **Batch Processing:** Handle multiple documents efficiently through batch operations.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous methods to improve application responsiveness.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you've learned how to sign image documents with QR codes using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This powerful feature secures your documents while simplifying verification processes.
