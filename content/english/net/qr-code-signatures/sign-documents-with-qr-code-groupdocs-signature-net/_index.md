## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Integrating GroupDocs.Signature into your project is straightforward. Here’s how to install it using different package managers:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore all functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** For extended testing, acquire a temporary license [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing for production use at [GroupDocs Purchase Portal](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To begin using GroupDocs.Signature, initialize the `Signature` object with your document path:
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH"))
{
    // Implementation steps will go here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: Sign Document with QR-Code
In this section, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to sign a document using a QR code that contains Mailmark2D object data. This feature enhances document security by embedding complex metadata in a compact and scannable format.

#### Step 1: Create the Mailmark2D Data Object
The `Mailmark2D` object holds essential properties such as country ID, item ID, supply chain information, and more. Here’s how to set it up:
```csharp
// Initialize the Mailmark2D data object with required details.
Mailmark2D mailmark2D = new Mailmark2D()
{
    UPUCountryID = "JGB ",
    InformationTypeID = "0",
    Class = "1",
    SupplyChainID = 123,
    ItemID = 1234,
    DestinationPostCodeAndDPS = "QWE1",
    RTSFlag = "0",
    ReturnToSenderPostCode = "QWE2",
    DataMatrixType = Mailmark2DType.Type_7,
    CustomerContentEncodeMode = DataMatrixEncodeMode.C40,
    CustomerContent = "CUSTOM"
};
```
**Explanation:** This object encapsulates metadata for tracking and identification purposes, embedding rich information within a QR code.

#### Step 2: Configure QrCodeSignOptions
Next, configure the QR code signature options to determine its appearance and position on the document:
```csharp
// Create and configure the QrCodeSignOptions object.
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions()
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100, // X-coordinate for positioning the QR code
    Top = 100,  // Y-coordinate for positioning the QR code
    Data = mailmark2D // Embedding Mailmark2D data within the QR code
};
```
**Explanation:** This snippet sets up the QR code’s encoding type and its placement on the document. The `Data` property links to our previously created `Mailmark2D` object.

#### Step 3: Sign the Document
Finally, use the configured options to sign your document:
```csharp
// Execute the signing process.
var signResult = signature.Sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH", options);
```
**Explanation:** This method applies the QR code signature to the specified output file path using the provided options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Invalid Document Path**: Ensure that the paths for input and output documents are correct and accessible.
- **Unsupported Encoding Type**: Verify that your chosen `EncodeType` is supported by GroupDocs.Signature.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for this feature:
1. **Supply Chain Management**: Embed tracking data within shipment documents to monitor goods throughout the supply chain.
2. **Legal Document Verification**: Enhance legal document security with embedded metadata accessible via QR code scanning.
3. **Customer Contracts**: Include personalized contract information inside a contract’s signature space using a QR code.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Signature, consider these performance optimization tips:
- Minimize resource-intensive operations during document signing to enhance speed.
- Ensure efficient memory management by disposing of objects like `Signature` after use.
- Utilize asynchronous methods if available for non-blocking operations.

## Conclusion
You’ve learned how to sign documents using QR codes with embedded Mailmark2D data using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This powerful feature not only enhances document security but also offers versatile tracking capabilities.

To take your skills further, explore additional GroupDocs.Signature functionalities and consider integrating them into larger workflows or systems. We encourage you to try implementing this solution in your projects to experience its benefits firsthand.
