- **Purchase:** For long-term use, purchase the full version at [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Initialize the `Signature` class to start working with documents:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize Signature instance
class DocumentSigner
{
    private readonly Signature _signature;
    
    public DocumentSigner(string documentPath)
    {
        _signature = new Signature(documentPath);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Signing a Document with Cryptocurrency QR-Code

This feature allows you to embed cryptocurrency transaction information in the form of a QR code into your PDF documents.

#### Step 1: Set Up Sign Options
Define the type of signature you want to apply. For this case, we’ll use a QR code:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Create QR-Code sign options with predefined text
class CryptoQrSigner
{
    public QrCodeSignOptions CreateCryptoQrOptions(string info)
    {
        return new QrCodeSignOptions(info)
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            Left = 100,
            Top = 100,
            Width = 200,
            Height = 200
        };
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Signature
Add the QR code to your document using the `Sign` method:

```csharp
// Sign and save the PDF file with QR-code signature
class DocumentProcessor
{
    private readonly Signature _signature;

    public DocumentProcessor(string documentPath)
    {
        _signature = new Signature(documentPath);
    }

    public void ApplySignature(QrCodeSignOptions options, string outputDirectory)
    {
        _signature.Sign(outputDirectory + "/SIGNED_PDF", options);
    }
}
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `QrCodeSignOptions`: Configures the QR code settings.
- `EncodeType`: Specifies the type of QR code; here we use standard QR.
- `Left`, `Top`, `Width`, and `Height` define the position and size on the document.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your file paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Check if the GroupDocs.Signature library is correctly installed in your project references.

## Practical Applications
This feature can be utilized in various real-world scenarios, such as:
1. **Secure Document Transactions:** Embed transaction details directly into legal or financial documents.
2. **Digital Contracts:** Enhance digital contracts with cryptocurrency payment details for immediate processing.
3. **Automated Workflow Integration:** Streamline workflows by embedding payment information within document approvals.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is crucial when handling large-scale document operations:
- **Efficient Memory Management:** Dispose of `Signature` objects promptly to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing:** When dealing with multiple documents, consider batch processing techniques to minimize overhead.
- **Concurrency:** Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve application responsiveness.

## Conclusion
You’ve now learned how to integrate cryptocurrency QR codes into PDF signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This feature not only enhances document security but also streamlines digital transactions seamlessly.
