- Implementing HIBC LIC QR Codes, Aztec Codes, and DataMatrix
- Adding HIBC PAS QR Codes, Aztec Codes, and DataMatrix
- Practical use cases and integration possibilities

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin implementing these features.

## Prerequisites

Before we start coding, ensure you have the following in place:

- **.NET Environment**: Make sure you have .NET installed on your system (preferably .NET Core or .NET 5/6+).
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: This library will be our primary tool. You can install it via NuGet.
- **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Familiarity with C# and handling files in .NET is recommended.

### Required Libraries

To use GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you need to add the package using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

For testing purposes, you can obtain a free trial license. For extended use, consider purchasing a subscription or requesting a temporary license:

- **Free Trial**: Access [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/)
- **Temporary License**: Request at [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)

### Environment Setup

Set up your environment by ensuring your project targets the appropriate .NET version and has access to GroupDocs.Signature. Initialize it in your application as shown:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
```

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you need to install the library and configure a basic setup within your project.

### Installation

Follow one of the methods mentioned above to add GroupDocs.Signature to your project. Once installed, ensure your project is configured to use it by referencing it in your code files.

### License Initialization

After acquiring a license, initialize it as follows:

```csharp
SignatureConfig signConfig = new SignatureConfig();
signConfig.LicensePath = "path/to/your/license.lic";
Signature signature = new Signature("Sample.pdf", signConfig);
```

This setup will allow you to access all features of GroupDocs.Signature without limitations.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into implementing each feature using HIBC QR Codes with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

### Sign Document with HIBC LIC QR-Code

#### Overview

Signing a document with an HIBC LIC QR Code ensures compliance and traceability in licensing scenarios. This section will guide you through creating and embedding a QR code within your PDF documents.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Configure the Source and Output Paths

Define where your source document is located and where the signed output should be saved:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithHIBCLICQR");
string destinFilePath = Path.Combine(outputPath, "SignedDocumentWithHIBCLICQR.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Create QR Code Sign Options

Configure your QR code with specific text and settings:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(sourceFilePath))
{
    var hibcLic_QR_Options = new QrCodeSignOptions("A123PROD30917/75#422011907#GP293", QrCodeTypes.HIBCLICQR)
    {
        Left = 1,
        Top = 1,
        ReturnContent = true,
        ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
    };

    // Sign the document with these options.
    signature.Sign(destinFilePath, hibcLic_QR_Options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- `QrCodeSignOptions` sets up the QR code's appearance and content. Here, we specify HIBC LIC QR Code type and position it on the document.
- `ReturnContent` set to true allows you to retrieve a rendered image of the signed document.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the document path is correctly specified.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Signature is properly licensed for full functionality.

### Sign Document with HIBC LIC Aztec Code

#### Overview

The Aztec code offers another form of encoding, suitable for high-density information storage. This section focuses on embedding an Aztec code into your documents using GroupDocs.Signature.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Configure Paths

Similar to the previous feature, define your file paths:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithHIBCLICAztec");
string destinFilePath = Path.Combine(outputPath, "SignedDocumentWithHIBCLICAztec.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Configure Aztec Code Options

Set up your Aztec code using GroupDocs.Signature:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(sourceFilePath))
{
    var hibcLic_AZ_Options = new QrCodeSignOptions("A123PROD30917/75#422011907#GP293", QrCodeTypes.HIBCLICAztec)
    {
        Left = 1,
        Top = 200,
        ReturnContent = true,
        ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
    };

    signature.Sign(destinFilePath, hibcLic_AZ_Options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `QrCodeSignOptions` is used again here but with the Aztec code type.
- Positioning (`Top`, `Left`) and content retrieval settings are similar to QR codes.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Confirm that the file paths are accurate.
- Ensure GroupDocs.Signature's version supports Aztec Code types.

### Sign Document with HIBC LIC DataMatrix

#### Overview

The DataMatrix code provides another robust method for storing data. This section demonstrates how to integrate a DataMatrix into your PDF documents.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Set File Paths

As before, establish where your files are located:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithHIBCLICDataMatrix");
string destinFilePath = Path.Combine(outputPath, "SignedDocumentWithHIBCLICDataMatrix.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Create DataMatrix Sign Options

Configure and apply the DataMatrix code:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(sourceFilePath))
{
    var hibcLic_DM_Options = new QrCodeSignOptions("A123PROD30917/75#422011907#GP293", QrCodeTypes.HIBCLICDataMatrix)
    {
        Left = 1,
        Top = 400,
        ReturnContent = true,
        ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
    };

    signature.Sign(destinFilePath, hibcLic_DM_Options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- `QrCodeSignOptions` is used to set up the DataMatrix code's appearance and content.
- Positioning (`Top`, `Left`) and retrieval settings follow the same pattern as previous codes.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all file paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Signature supports DataMatrix Code types in your version.

### Sign Document with HIBC PAS QR-Code

#### Overview

Signing documents with an HIBC PAS QR Code enhances product tracking and traceability. This section guides you through embedding a PAS QR code into PDFs using GroupDocs.Signature.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Configure the Source and Output Paths

Define where your source document is located and where the signed output should be saved:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Sample.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithHIBCPASQR");
string destinFilePath = Path.Combine(outputPath, "SignedDocumentWithHIBCPASQR.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Create QR Code Sign Options

Configure your PAS QR code with specific text and settings:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(sourceFilePath))
{
    var hibcPas_QR_Options = new QrCodeSignOptions("PAS123456789012", QrCodeTypes.HIBCPASQR)
    {
        Left = 1,
        Top = 500,
        ReturnContent = true,
        ReturnContentType = FileType.PNG
    };

    // Sign the document with these options.
    signature.Sign(destinFilePath, hibcPas_QR_Options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- `QrCodeSignOptions` is configured for HIBC PAS QR Code type and positioned on the document.
- `ReturnContent` set to true retrieves a rendered image of the signed document.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Signature supports PAS QR Code types in your version.
