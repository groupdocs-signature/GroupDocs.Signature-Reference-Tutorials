# Implementing Document Signing with QR Codes Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction

Ensuring document authenticity and integrity is crucial, yet it must not compromise user convenience. QR code-based document signing offers a solution that enhances security while streamlining the verification process. This approach makes verifying signed documents simpler than ever.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use GroupDocs.Signature for .NET to sign documents with a QR code. By leveraging this powerful library, you can seamlessly integrate advanced digital signature functionality into your applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to install and set up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
- A step-by-step guide to implementing QR code signing in your application
- Practical examples of real-world use cases
- Performance optimization tips specific to document handling

Let's begin by ensuring you meet the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have met these requirements:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: Include this library as a dependency in your project.
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core**: This tutorial is compatible with both environments.

### Environment Setup Requirements

- A development environment set up with Visual Studio or any IDE supporting .NET projects.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

Familiarity with C# and a basic understanding of digital signatures and QR codes will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To start, add the GroupDocs.Signature library to your project using one of these package managers:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open the NuGet Package Manager in your IDE.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Signature, consider these options:

- **Free Trial**: Ideal for testing and initial development phases.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain through their website if you need extended access without purchase.
- **Purchase**: Suitable for long-term commercial projects requiring full feature access.

Once you have a license, initialize your project setup with this basic configuration code snippet:

```csharp
// Initialize the Signature object\using (Signature signature = new Signature("sample.pdf"))
{
    // Your signing logic here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### QR Code Document Signing Feature Overview

This feature allows embedding a QR code as a digital signature on your documents, enhancing security and providing an easy verification method.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Signature Object

Create an instance of the `Signature` class by passing the document path:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed with QR code signing logic
}
```
**Explanation:** The `Signature` object is initialized to manage all signature operations on your specified document.

#### Step 2: Configure QR Code Options

Set up the QR code options that define how the QR code will be embedded:

```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions qrCodeOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("Your QR Code Text")
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 200
};
```
**Explanation:** This snippet creates a `QrCodeSignOptions` object specifying the text to encode, type of QR code, and its position on the document.

#### Step 3: Sign the Document

Apply the QR code signature to your document:

```csharp
signature.Sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signed_sample.pdf\
