}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the steps to sign a PDF with a QR code containing MeCard information.

### Creating and Configuring the MeCard Object
**Overview:**
The MeCard object holds contact details that will be encoded into a QR code.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Create a MeCard object with necessary contact details
MeCard vCard = new MeCard()
{
    Name = "Sherlock",
    Nickname = "Jay",
    Reading = "Holmes",
    Note = "Base Detective",
    Phone = "0333 003 3577",
    AltPhone = "0333 003 3512",
    Email = "watson@sherlockholmes.com",
    Url = "http://sherlockholmes.com/",
    BirthDay = new DateTime(1854, 1, 6),
    Address = new Address()
    {
        Street = "221B Baker Street",
        City = "London",
        State = "NW",
        ZIP = "NW16XE",
        Country = "England"
    }
};
```

### Creating QR Code Sign Options
**Overview:**
Configure the QR code options to include the MeCard data.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Configure QR code sign options
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR, // Specify the type of QR code
    Data = vCard,                // Embed MeCard information into the QR code
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
    Width = 100,                 // Set the width of the QR code
    Height = 100,                // Set the height of the QR code
    Margin = new Padding(10)     // Define margin around the QR code
};
```

### Signing the Document
**Overview:**
Apply the configured QR code to your PDF document.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.pdf";
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/QRCodeMeCardObject.pdf";

using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Sign and save the document with QR code
    signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure all paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Signature library is properly installed.
- Check for any discrepancies in data formatting.
