# Implement QR-Code Signature Search with Custom Encryption in .NET

## Introduction

Securing documents and verifying their authenticity is essential in today's digital world. QR-code signatures offer an innovative solution to these challenges. Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, you can search for these signatures while applying custom encryption options. This tutorial guides you through implementing a feature that searches for QR-Code signatures with specific encryption settings.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Search for QR-code signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
- Implement custom data signature classes.
- Apply custom encryption to enhance document security.
- Troubleshoot common issues during implementation.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: Install this library to handle document signatures effectively.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment supporting .NET (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming in C#.
- Understanding of encryption and security principles (basic knowledge is sufficient for this tutorial).

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Install the GroupDocs.Signature library using one of the following methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Signature, you need a license. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license:
- **Free Trial**: Available on [GroupDocs release page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/net/).
- **Temporary License**: Obtain it from the [temporary license page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a license at [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

After acquiring your license, initialize GroupDocs.Signature in your project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
// Initialize the signature handler with the licensing option.
SignatureConfig config = new SignatureConfig();
config.LicensePath = "path/to/your/license.lic";
SignatureHandler signatureHandler = new SignatureHandler(config);
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll guide you through implementing key features, starting with setting up a custom data signature class.

### Define Custom Data Signature Class

**Overview:**
Define a custom data structure for QR-code signatures to embed specific information like authorship or date within the QR-code.

#### Step 1: Create the `DocumentSignatureData` Class
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain.Extensions;
using System;

private class DocumentSignatureData
{
    [Format("SignID")]
    public string ID { get; set; }
    
    [Format("SAuth")]
    public string Author { get; set; }

    [Format("SDate")]
    public DateTime DateSigned { get; set; }
}
```
**Explanation:**
- The `DocumentSignatureData` class stores data for QR-code signatures.
- Use attributes like `[Format]` to specify the appearance of each property in the signature.

#### Step 2: Configure Encryption

Encrypting your document enhances security, ensuring that only authorized users can access or verify the signatures. GroupDocs.Signature supports various encryption algorithms.

**Configure QR-Code Signature Search with Encryption Options:**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
// Create a search option with encryption
QrCodeSearchOptions options = new QrCodeSearchOptions()
{
    // Set your custom data here
    Data = new DocumentSignatureData { ID = "12345", Author = "John Doe", DateSigned = DateTime.Now },
    
    // Specify the encryption algorithm, e.g., AES
    EncryptionAlgorithm = EncryptionAlgorithm.AES,
    KeySize = 256,
    Password = "YourSecurePassword"
};
```
**Explanation:**
- `QrCodeSearchOptions` lets you define parameters for searching QR-code signatures.
- Set your custom data and specify the encryption algorithm, key size, and password.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Issue**: Signature not found in document.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that the signature is correctly embedded with valid data format attributes.
- **Issue**: Encryption errors during search.
  - **Solution**: Verify that the correct password and key size are used for decryption.

## Practical Applications

Explore real-world applications of this feature:
1. **Contract Management Systems:** Securely sign contracts using QR-code signatures, ensuring only authorized personnel can verify them.
2. **Medical Records Security:** Encrypt patient records with QR-code signatures to maintain confidentiality.
3. **E-commerce Platforms:** Validate product authenticity using encrypted QR-code signatures.

Integrate these features with systems like CRM or ERP for enhanced document management and security.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Ensure efficient memory usage by disposing of objects that are no longer needed.
- **Best Practices for .NET Memory Management:** Use `using` statements to manage resource disposal automatically.

```csharp
// Example of resource management
using (SignatureHandler handler = new SignatureHandler(config))
{
    // Perform signature operations here
}
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to implement QR-code signature search with custom encryption using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This feature enhances document security and ensures authenticity in various applications.

Next steps could include exploring other features of GroupDocs.Signature or integrating it into larger systems for comprehensive document management solutions.

**Call-to-Action**: Implement these steps in your projects to secure and manage documents effectively!
