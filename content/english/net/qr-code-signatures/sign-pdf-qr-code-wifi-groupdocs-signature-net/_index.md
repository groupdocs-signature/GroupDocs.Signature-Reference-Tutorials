- How to sign a PDF with a QR code using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
- Embedding WiFi credentials within the QR code.
- Setting up your environment and installing necessary libraries.
- Implementing practical applications of this feature.

Let's start by setting up the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies:
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**: The core library used for signing documents.

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment running .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+.
- An IDE such as Visual Studio.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with handling files in .NET applications.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Signature, install the package in your project. Hereâ€™s how:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition:

#### Basic Initialization:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
// Initialize a Signature instance with the PDF file path.
Signature signature = new Signature(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePDF.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Signing Document with QR Code

This feature demonstrates how to digitally sign a PDF document using a QR code that contains WiFi settings.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Document Path and Output Location
```csharp
string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePDF.pdf";
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedSamplePDF.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Create a QR Code with WiFi Information

Using the `QrCodeSignOptions`, specify your WiFi settings:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Domain;

// Define WiFi credentials to embed in the QR code.
var wifiInfo = new QrCodeWiFi(QrCodeWiFiFrequancy.FiveHundredMhz, "YourNetworkSSID", "password");

QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions(wifiInfo)
{
    EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100
};
```

#### Step 3: Sign the Document

Invoke the `Sign` method to apply the QR code signature:

```csharp
// Sign and save the document.
signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify WiFi settings (SSID and password) for proper encoding.

## Practical Applications

1. **Corporate Networking**: Automate access sharing by embedding network credentials in signed documents.
2. **Event Management**: Provide attendees with easy access to event-specific networks via QR codes.
3. **Retail**: Offer customers seamless connectivity within stores using embedded WiFi QR codes.
4. **Hospitality**: Enable guests to connect effortlessly to hotel networks through their digital receipts.
5. **Education**: Share secure and controlled campus network access in student handbooks.
