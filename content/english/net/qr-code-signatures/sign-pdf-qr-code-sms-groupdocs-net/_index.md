# How to Sign a PDF Document with a QR Code Containing an SMS Object Using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

## Introduction
In the digital age, ensuring document integrity and authenticity is crucial. Electronic signatures provide security and convenience for handling sensitive information like contracts and approvals. This guide shows how to enhance this process by embedding additional data within your signatures: signing PDF documents with QR codes containing SMS objects using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

By integrating QR codes into digital signatures, you can streamline document workflows and improve communication efficiency, providing quick access to supplementary information like approval notifications via SMS.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up your environment with GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.
- Steps to sign a PDF using a QR code containing an SMS object.
- Key configuration options for QR code signing.
- Practical applications and performance considerations.

Let's start by covering the prerequisites needed before implementing this feature.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
1. **Required Libraries:**
   - GroupDocs.Signature for .NET library (version 21.3 or later).
2. **Environment Setup:**
   - A development environment compatible with .NET Framework or .NET Core.
   - Visual Studio IDE installed on your machine.
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of C# programming.
   - Familiarity with handling PDF documents programmatically.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET
### Installation
To begin, install the GroupDocs.Signature library in your project using these package managers:

**.NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use GroupDocs.Signature, you can:
- **Free Trial:** Download a trial package to test out features.
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license for evaluation purposes.
- **Purchase:** Buy a commercial license if it meets your needs.

Once installed, initialize and set up the library as shown below:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;

// Initialize Signature object with input file path
Signature signature = new Signature("SamplePDF.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide
### Overview of Signing PDF with QR Code SMS Object
The goal is to sign a PDF document using a QR code that encodes an SMS message, authenticating the document and providing additional information.

#### Step 1: Create an SMS Object
First, define the details for your SMS object:
```csharp
var sms = new GroupDocs.Signature.Domain.SMS
{
    Number = "0800 048 0408",
    Message = "Document approval automatic SMS message"
};
```
**Explanation:** 
- `Number`: The phone number to which the SMS will be sent.
- `Message`: The content of the SMS, providing context or notification about the document.

#### Step 2: Configure QR Code Sign Options
Next, set up your QR code options:
```csharp
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions
{
    EncodeType = GroupDocs.Signature.Options.QrCodeTypes.QR,
    Data = sms,
    HorizontalAlignment = System.Drawing.HorizontalAlignment.Left,
    VerticalAlignment = System.Drawing.VerticalAlignment.Center,
    Width = 100,
    Height = 100,
    Margin = new Padding(10)
};
```
**Explanation:**
- `EncodeType`: Specifies the type of QR code.
- `Data`: The SMS object containing the message and number.
- `HorizontalAlignment` & `VerticalAlignment`: Positioning options for the QR code on the document.
- `Width`, `Height`: Dimensions of the QR code.
- `Margin`: Space around the QR code.

#### Step 3: Sign the Document
Finally, sign your PDF:
```csharp
signature.Sign("SignedQRCodeSMSObject.pdf", options);
```
**Explanation:** 
This method saves a signed copy of the document with the specified options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues:** Ensure paths are correct and permissions are set for file read/write operations.
- **Data Integrity:** Verify SMS data is correctly encoded before signing.

## Practical Applications
1. **Contract Management:**
   - Automatically notify stakeholders via SMS upon contract approval with embedded QR code signatures.
2. **Document Workflow Automation:**
   - Enhance efficiency by embedding contact information or instructions in document signatures.
3. **Secure Sharing:**
   - Use QR codes to provide additional layers of verification and authentication for shared documents.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimizing Performance:** Pre-process large batches of documents offline when possible.
- **Resource Usage Guidelines:** Monitor memory usage, especially with large PDF files.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update your GroupDocs.Signature library to leverage performance improvements.

## Conclusion
You've learned how to enhance document signing by integrating QR codes with SMS objects using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This powerful feature secures documents and adds functionality that improves workflow and communication.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement this solution in your projects.
- Explore the [GroupDocs documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/net/) for more advanced capabilities.
