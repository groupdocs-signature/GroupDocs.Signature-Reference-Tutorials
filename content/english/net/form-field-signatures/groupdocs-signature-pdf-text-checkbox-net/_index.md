## Implementation Guide

We'll guide you through implementing PDF signatures using different form fields. Each section provides a step-by-step approach to help you understand and execute the process efficiently.

### Sign PDF with Text Form Field

Text form fields are ideal for adding custom text signatures to your documents. Let's explore how to achieve this:

#### Overview
This feature allows you to sign a PDF document using a specified text field, making it perfect for personalized digital agreements.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Instantiate Text Form Field Signature**

Define the text signature with its name and value:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Define the text form field signature
FormFieldSignature textSignature = new TextFormFieldSignature("tbData1", "Value-1");
```

**2. Configure Sign Options**

Set up options like position, height, and width for your signature:

```csharp
// Configure form field sign options
FormFieldSignOptions optionsTextFF = new FormFieldSignOptions(textSignature)
{
    Top = 200,
    Left = 50,
    Height = 20,
    Width = 200
};
```

**3. Sign the Document**

Use the `Signature` class to apply your text signature:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH"))
{
    // Apply the text form field signature
    SignResult signResultTextFF = signature.Sign("OUTPUT_PATH", optionsTextFF);
}
```

### Sign PDF with Checkbox Form Field

Checkbox fields are useful for agreements where users need to indicate acceptance or approval.

#### Overview
This feature adds a checkbox as a digital signature, making it easy to include user consent in documents.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Instantiate Checkbox Form Field Signature**

Create the checkbox field and set its default checked state:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Define the checkbox form field signature
CheckboxFormFieldSignature chbSignature = new CheckboxFormFieldSignature("chbData1", true);
```

**2. Configure Sign Options**

Adjust the position, size, and other attributes for your checkbox signature:

```csharp
// Set up options for signing with a checkbox form field
FormFieldSignOptions optionsTextCHB = new FormFieldSignOptions(chbSignature)
{
    Top = 300,
    Left = 50,
    Height = 20,
    Width = 200
};
```

**3. Sign the Document**

Implement the checkbox signature using `Signature`:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH"))
{
    // Apply the checkbox form field signature
    SignResult signResultTextCHB = signature.Sign("OUTPUT_PATH", optionsTextCHB);
}
```

### Sign PDF with Digital Form Field

Digital signatures ensure authenticity and integrity, making them essential for legal documents.

#### Overview
This feature allows embedding a digital form field signature in your PDFs to enhance security and trustworthiness.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Instantiate Digital Form Field Signature**

Create the digital signature object:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

// Define the digital form field signature
digitalSignature = new DigitalFormFieldSignature("dgData1");
```

**2. Configure Sign Options**

Configure attributes such as position, height, and width for your digital signature:

```csharp
// Set up options for signing with a digital form field
FormFieldSignOptions optionsTextDIG = new FormFieldSignOptions(digSignature)
{
    Top = 400,
    Left = 50,
    Height = 20,
    Width = 200
};
```

**3. Sign the Document**

Use `Signature` to apply your digital signature:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH"))
{
    // Apply the digital form field signature
    SignResult signResultTextDIG = signature.Sign("OUTPUT_PATH", optionsTextDIG);
}
```

## Practical Applications

Understanding how and where you can use these features is vital. Here are some real-world applications:

1. **Legal Agreements:** Use text fields for custom clauses or signatures in contracts.
