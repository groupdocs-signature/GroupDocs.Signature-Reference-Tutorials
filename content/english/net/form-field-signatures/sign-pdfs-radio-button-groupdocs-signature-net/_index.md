## Implementation Guide
This section guides you through creating a PDF signature using radio button form fields.

### Creating Radio Button Form Fields for Signing
#### Overview
Use radio buttons to allow the signer to select from predefined choices, ideal for conditional responses in forms.

#### Code Implementation
1. **Initialize Signature Object**
   Start by initializing the `Signature` object with your PDF file.
   ```csharp
   using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
   {
       // Your code here...
   }
   ```
2. **Define Radio Button Options**
   Create a list of options for the radio button field.
   ```csharp
   List<string> radioOptions = new List<string>() { "One", "Two", "Three" };
   ```
3. **Create RadioButtonFormFieldSignature Object**
   Instantiate `RadioButtonFormFieldSignature` with a default selected option.
   ```csharp
   RadioButtonFormFieldSignature radioSignature = 
       new RadioButtonFormFieldSignature("radioData1", radioOptions, "Two");
   ```
4. **Configure Form Field Signature Options**
   Set the position and size of the form field on the PDF page.
   ```csharp
   FormFieldSignOptions options = new FormFieldSignOptions(radioSignature)
   {
       Top = 200,
       Left = 50,
       Height = 90,
       Width = 200
   };
   ```
5. **Sign and Save the Document**
   Execute the signing process and save the signed document.
   ```csharp
   SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
   Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {signResult.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}.\n");
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that the PDF is not password protected or locked from modifications.

## Practical Applications
This feature can be highly beneficial in scenarios like:
1. **Survey Forms**: Use radio buttons for quick responses.
2. **Contracts and Agreements**: Offer predefined options for clauses.
3. **Feedback Collection**: Simplify user feedback with radio choices.
4. **Registration Forms**: Implement conditional logic based on selections.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Limit the number of form fields to reduce processing time.
- Manage resources effectively by disposing of objects properly.
- Follow .NET best practices for memory management, such as avoiding unnecessary object creation.
