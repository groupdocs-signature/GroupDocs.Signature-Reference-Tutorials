## Introduction

In today's digital world, ensuring document authenticity, origin tracking, and integrity has become essential for businesses and organizations. Metadata signatures provide a powerful yet unobtrusive way to embed identifying information directly into document files, enhancing security without altering their visual appearance.

GroupDocs.Signature for .NET offers a comprehensive solution for signing various document types with metadata, allowing developers to integrate robust document verification capabilities into their .NET applications. This article provides an overview of metadata signing capabilities for different document formats and links to detailed tutorials for each document type.

## What is Metadata Signing?

Metadata signing involves embedding additional information (metadata) directly into a document's file structure. This information can include:

- Author details
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Document identifiers
- Version information
- Custom application-specific data
- Digital fingerprints

Unlike visible signatures, metadata signatures are embedded within the document's internal structure and do not alter its visual appearance, making them ideal for maintaining document aesthetics while still adding verification capabilities.

## Advantages of Metadata Signatures

- Non-intrusive: Does not alter the document's appearance
- Versatile: Can store various data types (text, dates, numbers)
- Traceable: Enhances document lineage and origin verification
- Customizable: Supports custom properties specific to business needs
- Searchable: Makes documents easier to categorize and find
- Lightweight: Minimal impact on file size

## Sign Image with Metadata

Digital images often require authentication and origin verification, especially in industries like photography, journalism, and digital media. GroupDocs.Signature enables you to embed metadata directly into various image formats, including ownership details, capture information, and copyright notices.

Our [comprehensive guide](./sign-image-with-metadata/) walks you through the process of signing images with metadata using C#, ensuring your visual assets remain traceable and verifiable throughout their lifecycle.

## Sign PDF with Metadata

PDF documents are the standard for business-critical information exchange due to their consistency across platforms. Enhancing PDFs with metadata signatures adds an extra layer of security and traceability.
