## Implementation Guide
### Sign PDF Document with Text Sticker
This section demonstrates how to add a text sticker signature to a PDF document using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. The process involves defining sign options and configuring appearance settings.

#### Step 1: Set Up File Paths
Define the input and output paths for your PDF files:
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PdfSticker.pdf";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Create a `Signature` object with the path to your input document.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Code for signing will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Text Sign Options
Define and configure text sign options for your sticker:
```csharp
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
{
    Left = 50,
    Top = 200,
    Width = 100,
    Height = 30,
    
    SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Sticker,
    
    Appearance = new PdfTextStickerAppearance()
    {
        Icon = PdfTextStickerIcon.Star,
        Opened = false,
        Contents = "Sample",
        Subject = "Sample subject",
        Title = "Sample Title"
    },
    
    Margin = new Padding() { Bottom = 20, Right = 20 },
    ForeColor = Color.Red,
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Comic Sans MS" }
};
```
**Explanation**: Here, we're setting the position (`Left`, `Top`), size (`Width`, `Height`), and appearance of the sticker. The `SignatureImplementation` property specifies that this is a text sticker signature.

#### Step 4: Execute Signing
Call the `Sign` method to apply the signature:
```csharp
SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```
This method will save your signed document at the specified output path.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Ensure Path Validity**: Make sure input and output paths are correctly set.
- **Check Library Versions**: Ensure you're using compatible versions of .NET and GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

## Practical Applications
1. **Contract Signing**: Quickly sign agreements with your company logo as a text sticker.
2. **Approval Documents**: Add an approval stamp to internal documents.
3. **Custom Annotations**: Use different icons and texts to denote document status or categories.

Integration possibilities include:
- Automating workflows in enterprise systems
- Enhancing document management applications

## Performance Considerations
When working with large PDFs, consider the following:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly.
- Utilize asynchronous methods if supported by your application requirements.
- Monitor resource consumption and adjust settings accordingly.
