- **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a license via the [GroupDocs Purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Signature by creating an instance of the `Signature` class. This will be your starting point for signing documents.
## Implementation Guide
With your environment ready, let’s walk through adding a text signature to a PDF using GroupDocs.Signature.
### Adding a Text Signature to a PDF Document
#### Overview
This section shows how to sign a PDF document with the text "Hello world!" by creating `TextSignOptions`, which allows you to define signature properties and apply it to your document.
#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Specify paths for both input and output files, ensuring directories exist and have appropriate permissions.
```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf"); // Replace 'sample.pdf' with your document name.
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "HelloWorld", fileName); // Ensure that YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY exists and has write permissions.
```
#### Step 2: Initialize the Signature Object
Create a `Signature` object using the file path to manage signing operations for your document.
```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Proceed to create and apply text sign options.
}
```
The `using` statement ensures proper resource disposal after usage.
#### Step 3: Create TextSignOptions
Define the properties of your text signature using `TextSignOptions`, including setting the text, position, size, and other styling attributes if needed.
```csharp
TextSignOptions textSignOptions = new TextSignOptions("Hello world!");
```
#### Step 4: Sign the Document
Apply the text signature by calling the `Sign()` method with your defined options. The signed document will be saved at the specified path.
```csharp
signature.Sign(outputFilePath, textSignOptions);
```
The signed document is now available at `outputFilePath`.
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Access Issues**: Ensure both input and output directories have necessary read/write permissions.
- **Signature Not Appearing**: Verify that file paths are correctly defined and accessible.
## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Signature for .NET extends beyond text signatures, offering real-world use cases:
1. **Contract Management**: Automate contract signing processes in legal firms or corporations.

3. **Custom Branding**: Add custom logos and branding elements as part of the signature for enhanced corporate identity.
4. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Seamlessly integrate electronic signatures into your customer relationship management workflows.
## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is key when working with GroupDocs.Signature:
- **Resource Usage Guidelines**: Ensure adequate memory and processing power, especially when handling large documents or batch processing.
- **Best Practices for .NET Memory Management**: Properly manage resources by using `using` statements for objects like `Signature`.
