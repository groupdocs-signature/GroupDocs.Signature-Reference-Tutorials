## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To get started, you'll need to install the GroupDocs.Signature library. Here are a few methods you can use:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**

{
    // Your document is ready for signing operations
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Sign Document with Text Stamp

Let's break down how to sign a document using the text stamp feature.

#### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Ensure your project has GroupDocs.Signature installed and set up as described above. 

#### Step 2: Create the Signature Options

Configure the `TextSignOptions` class to specify signature details like text, alignment, and margins:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;

string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to source file
string fileName = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithTextStamp", fileName);

using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
    {
        SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Native,
        VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
        HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
        Margin = new Padding(20)
    };

    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `TextSignOptions`: Defines the text content and appearance of your stamp.
  - `SignatureImplementation`: Specifies using native implementation for optimal performance.
  - `VerticalAlignment` & `HorizontalAlignment`: Aligns the signature in the desired position.
  - `Margin`: Adds spacing around the text to prevent it from being cut off.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure file paths are correct; incorrect paths will lead to errors.
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Signature.

### Load Document for Signing

Before signing, you need to load your document into a `Signature` object. Here's how:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to the source file

using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // The document is now ready for signing operations.
}
```

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Signature can be used in several real-world scenarios, such as:
- Automating contract approval workflows
- Signing digital invoices or purchase orders
- Integrating with CRM systems to handle client agreements

These applications demonstrate the library’s versatility across various industries and use cases.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET, consider these performance tips:

- Optimize document loading by handling exceptions gracefully.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of `Signature` objects promptly after use.
- Utilize asynchronous operations where possible to enhance application responsiveness.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to implement a text stamp signature using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. You're now equipped to incorporate document signing into your applications effortlessly and securely.
