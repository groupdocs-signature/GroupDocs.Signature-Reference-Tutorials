# How to Add Text Stamp to PDF in C#

## Introduction

Ever needed to add "APPROVED", "CONFIDENTIAL", or custom text stamps to hundreds of PDF documents? Doing it manually is tedious, error-prone, and frankly, a waste of your time. Whether you're processing invoices, contracts, or certificates, automating text stamp placement can save you hours every week.

Here's the thing: most developers start by looking at complex digital signature APIs when all they need is a simple text stamp. This guide cuts through the confusion and shows you exactly how to programmatically add text stamps to PDFs using C# and GroupDocs.Signature for .NET.

**In this article, you'll discover:**
- How to set up and configure text stamp signatures in minutes
- Step-by-step code implementation (with working examples you can copy)
- When to use text stamps vs other signature types
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Real-world applications across different industries

By the end, you'll be able to automate document stamping in your applications and never manually stamp a PDF again. Let's get started!

## Why Use Text Stamps for PDF Documents?

Before we dive into the code, let's clarify what text stamps are and why they're useful.

**What's a text stamp?** It's basically a text-based overlay that appears on your document - think of it like a watermark, but more focused and purposeful. Unlike digital signatures (which provide cryptographic verification), text stamps are visual indicators that show document status, approval, ownership, or classification.

**When should you use text stamps?**
- **Internal workflows**: Marking documents as "DRAFT", "REVIEWED", or "APPROVED"
- **Document classification**: Adding "CONFIDENTIAL" or "INTERNAL USE ONLY"
- **Timestamps**: Showing when a document was processed
- **Ownership marking**: Adding company names or department labels
- **Status indicators**: "PAID", "VOID", "COPY" on invoices and receipts

**When NOT to use them?**
- Legal signatures requiring cryptographic validation (use digital signatures instead)
- High-security scenarios where tampering must be detected
- When you need handwritten signature appearance (use image signatures)

Text stamps are perfect for automated workflows where you need quick, visible markers without the complexity of certificate management.

## Prerequisites

Before we start coding, make sure you have these basics covered:

### Required Tools and Libraries
- **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET** (the library we'll be using)
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1+** or **.NET Core 2.0+** (check compatibility for your version)
- **Visual Studio** or any C# IDE you're comfortable with

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# (you should know what classes and methods are)
- Familiarity with file I/O operations
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts (helpful but not critical)

### What You Should Have Ready
- Sample PDF documents for testing
- Output directory for signed documents
- GroupDocs license (or temporary license for testing)

Don't worry if you're new to document processing libraries - we'll walk through everything step by step.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

Getting the library installed is straightforward. Choose the method that fits your workflow:

### Installation Options

**.NET CLI** (fastest method)
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console** (if you're in Visual Studio)
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
1. Right-click your project â†’ Manage NuGet Packages
2. Search for "GroupDocs.Signature"
3. Click Install on the latest stable version

### License Setup

You've got three options here:

1. **Free Trial**: Great for testing - download from the GroupDocs website
2. **Temporary License**: Extends trial period for development (no credit card needed)
3. **Full License**: Required for production use

Once you have your license file, initialize it like this:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("path/to/your/document"))
{
    // Your document is ready for signing operations
}
```

**Pro tip**: Store your license path in configuration files (not hardcoded) so you can easily switch between development and production licenses.

## Implementation Guide: Adding Text Stamps to PDFs

Now for the fun part - let's actually add text stamps to documents. We'll break this down into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

First, make sure your project references are correct and you have test documents ready:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Signature;
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
```

**Quick check**: If Visual Studio shows red squiggles under these using statements, your package installation might have failed. Try cleaning and rebuilding your solution.

### Step 2: Load Your PDF Document

Before you can add stamps, you need to load the document into memory:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to source file

using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // The document is now ready for signing operations.
}
```

**What's happening here?** The `using` statement ensures proper resource cleanup - even if something goes wrong, your file handles will be released. This prevents those annoying "file is being used by another process" errors.

**Path gotcha**: Make sure you're using the full absolute path or a properly resolved relative path. A common mistake is assuming the working directory is your project folder - it's usually bin/Debug or bin/Release.

### Step 3: Configure Text Stamp Options

This is where you define what your stamp looks like and where it appears:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to source file
string fileName = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignWithTextStamp", fileName);

using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
    {
        SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Native,
        VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
        HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
        Margin = new Padding(20)
    };

    SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
}
```

### Understanding the Configuration Parameters

Let's break down what each option does (because the documentation sometimes glosses over the practical implications):

**`TextSignOptions("John Smith")`**
- This is the text that'll appear on your document
- You can use any string here - names, statuses, dates, whatever
- Keep it concise - long text might overflow or look cramped

**`SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Native`**
- Uses the native rendering engine for best performance
- Alternative: `Image` implementation (renders text as image - slower but more consistent across viewers)
- Stick with Native unless you have compatibility issues

**`VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center`**
- Options: `Top`, `Center`, `Bottom`
- Centers your stamp vertically on the page
- Combine with `HorizontalAlignment` to position anywhere

**`HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left`**
- Options: `Left`, `Center`, `Right`
- In this example, stamp appears on the left side
- Most common setup: `Center` + `Center` for classic centered stamps

**`Margin = new Padding(20)`**
- Adds 20 pixels of space around your stamp
- Prevents text from touching page edges (looks cleaner)
- Accepts individual values: `new Padding(top: 10, right: 20, bottom: 10, left: 20)`

### Step 4: Apply the Stamp and Save

Once configured, applying the stamp is a single line:

```csharp
SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

**What gets returned?** The `SignResult` object contains:
- Success/failure status
- Details about applied signatures
- Any warnings or errors encountered

**Best practice**: Always check `signResult.Succeeded` before assuming the operation worked. Don't trust silent failures!

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Here are the issues that trip up developers most often (speaking from experience):

### 1. File Path Issues
**Problem**: "File not found" or "Access denied" errors
**Solution**: 
- Use `Path.GetFullPath()` to debug path resolution
- Check file permissions (especially on network drives)
- Ensure output directory exists before writing

### 2. Output File Already Exists
**Problem**: Operation fails because output file is locked
**Solution**: 
- Add timestamp to output filenames: `$"signed_{DateTime.Now:yyyyMMddHHmmss}_{fileName}"`
- Or check and delete existing file first (if appropriate)

### 3. Text Overflow or Truncation
**Problem**: Long text gets cut off or wraps awkwardly
**Solution**:
- Test with maximum expected text length
- Adjust margin and alignment settings
- Consider using smaller font sizes (we'll cover customization below)

### 4. Memory Leaks in Batch Processing
**Problem**: Application crashes after processing many documents
**Solution**:
- Always use `using` statements for `Signature` objects
- Dispose of resources explicitly if not using `using`
- Process documents in batches with periodic cleanup

### 5. PDF Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Some PDFs don't accept stamps or render incorrectly
**Solution**:
- Test with PDFs from different sources
- Use PDF validation tools to check document integrity
- Consider PDF version compatibility (GroupDocs supports PDF 1.3+)

### 6. License Errors in Production
**Problem**: Works in dev but fails in production with licensing errors
**Solution**:
- Don't forget to deploy license file with application
- Set correct license file path in production config
- Test license validation in staging environment first

## Text Stamps vs Other Signature Types

Confused about when to use text stamps versus other options? Here's a practical comparison:

| Feature | Text Stamp | Digital Signature | Image Signature |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Legal Validity** | Visual only | Legally binding (with certificate) | Visual only |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Complex (requires certificates) | Medium |
| **File Size Impact** | Minimal | Small (adds signature data) | Medium to Large |
| **Tampering Detection** | None | Yes | None |
| **Customization** | High (fonts, colors) | Limited | High (any image) |
| **Best For** | Internal workflows, status marking | Legal documents, compliance | Handwritten appearance, logos |
| **Processing Speed** | Fastest | Medium | Slower |

**Use text stamps when**: You need quick, simple visual markers for internal processes

**Use digital signatures when**: Legal validity and tamper detection are critical

**Use image signatures when**: You need handwritten appearance or company logos

## Advanced Customization Options

Want to go beyond basic text stamps? Here are some ways to customize further (using properties available in `TextSignOptions`):

### Font and Styling
```csharp
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("CONFIDENTIAL")
{
    // ... basic settings ...
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 24, Bold = true },
    ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red,
    BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.Yellow
};
```

**When to use this**: Creating attention-grabbing stamps like "URGENT" or "CONFIDENTIAL"

### Rotation and Angle
```csharp
options.RotationAngle = 45; // Diagonal stamp
```

**When to use this**: Watermark-style stamps that shouldn't obscure content

### Transparency
```csharp
options.Transparency = 0.5; // 50% transparent
```

**When to use this**: Background stamps that need to show underlying text

### Multiple Stamps
```csharp
// Apply multiple stamps in one operation
List<SignOptions> multipleOptions = new List<SignOptions>
{
    new TextSignOptions("DRAFT") { /* ... */ },
    new TextSignOptions("Page 1 of 5") { /* ... */ }
};

signature.Sign(outputFilePath, multipleOptions);
```

**When to use this**: Complex document processing with multiple markers

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

Let's look at how different industries use text stamps in practice:

### 1. Legal Firms
**Scenario**: Marking contract status
**Implementation**: Add "EXECUTED - [Date]" stamps to finalized contracts
**Why it works**: Quick visual confirmation of document status in client portals

### 2. Accounting Departments
**Scenario**: Processing invoices
**Implementation**: Stamp "PAID - [Date]" on processed invoices
**Why it works**: Prevents duplicate payments and provides audit trail

### 3. HR Departments
**Scenario**: Employee document management
**Implementation**: Add "RECEIVED - [Date]" stamps to submitted applications
**Why it works**: Tracks document receipt for compliance purposes

### 4. Healthcare Providers
**Scenario**: Medical record classification
**Implementation**: Stamp "PATIENT COPY" or "CONFIDENTIAL" on records
**Why it works**: Ensures proper handling and distribution of sensitive documents

### 5. Educational Institutions
**Scenario**: Certificate issuance
**Implementation**: Add "OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT" stamps with issue dates
**Why it works**: Distinguishes official documents from copies

## Performance Considerations and Best Practices

When you're processing thousands of documents, performance matters. Here's how to optimize:

### Memory Management
- **Always dispose**: Use `using` statements or explicit `Dispose()` calls
- **Batch processing**: Don't load all documents into memory at once
- **Monitor memory**: Use profiling tools to catch leaks early

### Speed Optimization
- **Native implementation**: Stick with `TextSignatureImplementation.Native` for speed
- **Minimize I/O**: Process from memory streams when possible
- **Parallel processing**: Use `Parallel.ForEach` for batch operations (with caution - test thread safety first)

### Error Handling
```csharp
try
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        // ... signing logic ...
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the error with context
    Console.WriteLine($"Failed to process {filePath}: {ex.Message}");
    // Implement retry logic or move file to error queue
}
```

**Why this matters**: In production, silent failures are worse than crashes. Always log and handle errors appropriately.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### "GroupDocs.Signature.GroupDocsSignatureException: The document is corrupted"
**Cause**: PDF file is damaged or invalid
**Fix**: Validate PDF integrity using PDF readers before processing

### "System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to path is denied"
**Cause**: Insufficient file permissions
**Fix**: Check write permissions on output directory, run with elevated privileges, or choose different output location

### "Text stamp appears in wrong position"
**Cause**: Coordinate system confusion or margin miscalculation
**Fix**: Test with extreme values (all edges), adjust margins incrementally, verify page dimensions match expectations

### "Stamp doesn't appear on all pages"
**Cause**: Options apply to first page only by default
**Fix**: Use `PagesSetup` property to specify page range or apply to all pages

### "Output file is much larger than expected"
**Cause**: Image implementation or high-resolution rendering
**Fix**: Switch to Native implementation, optimize font settings, check if unnecessary resources are embedded

### "License validation fails in deployed application"
**Cause**: License file not found or incorrect path
**Fix**: Verify license file is included in deployment, use relative paths from application directory, check file permissions

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add text stamps to PDF documents programmatically using C# and GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. Let's recap the key takeaways:

- Text stamps are perfect for **internal workflows and status marking** (not legal signatures)
- Setup is straightforward - **install package, configure options, apply stamp**
- **Position and appearance** are highly customizable through TextSignOptions
- Always handle **errors and dispose resources properly** in production code
- Consider **performance implications** when processing large document batches

### Next Steps

Ready to take this further? Here are some ideas:

1. **Integrate with your existing workflow**: Add text stamping to your document processing pipeline
2. **Explore other signature types**: Try digital signatures for legal documents or image signatures for logos
3. **Build a document automation tool**: Create a service that stamps documents based on business rules

The code examples in this guide are production-ready - you can literally copy, adjust the paths, and start stamping documents today.

## FAQ Section

**Q: Can I add text stamps to documents other than PDFs?**
A: Yes! GroupDocs.Signature supports Word documents (.docx), Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), and many other formats. The code remains nearly identical - just change your input file.

**Q: How do I add different stamps to different pages?**
A: Use the `PagesSetup` property in `TextSignOptions`. Example: `options.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup { FirstPage = true }` for page 1 only, or specify page ranges.

**Q: Can text stamps be removed or edited after applying?**
A: Text stamps added this way become part of the document content. While technically possible to remove (using PDF editing tools), they're not designed to be removable. For removable markers, consider using annotations instead.

**Q: What's the performance impact of adding stamps to large PDFs?**
A: Minimal for single stamps with Native implementation. Expect 100-500ms for typical documents. Image implementation is slower (~2-5x). Batch operations scale linearly with document count.

**Q: How do I handle stamp positioning on documents with different page sizes?**
A: Use percentage-based positioning or calculate positions based on page dimensions. You can query page sizes using GroupDocs.Signature and adjust margins accordingly.

**Q: Can I use custom fonts for text stamps?**
A: Yes, through the `Font` property in `TextSignOptions`. Make sure the font is installed on the system running the code, or provide font file paths.

**Q: Is there a limit to text stamp length?**
A: No hard limit, but practical limitations exist based on page size and font size. Test with expected maximum length to ensure text doesn't overflow or wrap unexpectedly.

**Q: How do I add stamps to password-protected PDFs?**
A: Provide the password when creating the `Signature` object: `new Signature(filePath, new LoadOptions { Password = "yourPassword" })`

**Q: Can I stamp multiple documents simultaneously?**
A: Yes, use `Parallel.ForEach` or `Task.Run` for concurrent processing. However, test thread safety thoroughly and monitor resource usage to avoid overwhelming your system.

**Q: What happens if the output file already exists?**
A: By default, it gets overwritten. Implement custom logic if you need different behavior (append timestamp, skip, prompt, etc.).
