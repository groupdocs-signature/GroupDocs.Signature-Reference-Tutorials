## Implementation Guide

### Signing a Document with Text Signature and Solid Brush
This feature demonstrates how to sign a PDF document using a text signature. We'll apply a solid brush for visual enhancement.

#### Overview of the Feature
We will create a text signature, configure its appearance, and apply it to your PDF document programmatically.

##### Step 1: Configure Text Signature Options
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
using System.Drawing;

// Create text signature options with custom settings
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("Your Signature")
{
    // Specify the location on the page
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,

    // Set font and size
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Arial" },

    // Apply solid brush background
    BackgroundBrush = new SolidBrush(Color.LightGray)
};
```
- **Parameters**: Adjust `Left` and `Top` to position the signature. The `BackgroundBrush` applies a light gray background using `SolidBrush`.

##### Step 2: Sign the Document
```csharp
// Apply the signature to the document
signature.Sign("output/document.pdf", options);
```
- **Return Value**: This method saves the signed PDF with the specified options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the file paths are correctly set.
- Verify that your development environment has access to all necessary permissions for reading and writing files.
- Check if GroupDocs.Signature is properly installed and configured.
