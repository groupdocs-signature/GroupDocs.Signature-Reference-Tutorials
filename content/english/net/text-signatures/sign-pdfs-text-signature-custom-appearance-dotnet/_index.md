### Basic Initialization and Setup:
Here's how you can initialize the Signature object with your source document:

using (Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"))
{
    // Your signing logic here...
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down each feature step-by-step.

### Signing a Document with Text Signatures and Custom Appearance

#### Overview:
This feature allows you to add text signatures to your PDF documents while customizing their appearance using background colors, transparency levels, and texture brushes.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Firstly, set up the file paths for both input and output:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"; // Replace with your document path
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SignedTextureBrush.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Signature Object

Create a new instance of the `Signature` class to work with your document:

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
{
    // Additional signing logic will be added here...
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure TextSignOptions
Set up your text signature options, including appearance settings:

```csharp
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith")
{
    Background = new Background()
    {
        Color = Color.LimeGreen,
        Transparency = 0.5f,
        Brush = new TextureBrush("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/image_handwrite.jpg")
    },
    
    Width = 100,
    Height = 80,
    VerticalAlignment = Domain.VerticalAlignment.Center,
    HorizontalAlignment = Domain.HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    Margin = new Padding() { Top = 20, Right = 20 },
    SignatureImplementation = TextSignatureImplementation.Image
};
```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- **Background Color & Transparency**: Customize the visual appeal of your signature using `Color` and `Transparency`.
- **Texture Brush**: Enhance signatures with unique textures by specifying an image file path.

#### Step 4: Sign and Save Document

Finally, sign the document with these options and save it:

```csharp
SignResult signResult = signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure all file paths are correct to prevent I/O exceptions.
- Verify that your image file for the texture brush is accessible.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where these features can be invaluable:

1. **Contract Management**: Customize signatures for legal documents ensuring clarity and professionalism.
2. **Invoice Processing**: Add branded text signatures to invoices, reflecting corporate identity.
3. **Personal Document Authentication**: Use unique textures for personal document verification.

## Performance Considerations

When dealing with large PDF files or bulk processing, consider these tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly after use.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to improve responsiveness.

## Conclusion
