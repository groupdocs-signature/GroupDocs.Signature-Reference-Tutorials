This comprehensive guide shows you how to use the **GroupDocs.Signature for .NET** library to sign documents with text watermarks, adding an extra layer of security.

### What You'll Learn
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature in a .NET environment
- Implementing text watermarks as document signatures
- Key configuration options and troubleshooting tips

By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to securely sign documents using text watermarks. Let's cover the prerequisites before we start coding.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To follow along, ensure your environment includes:
- .NET Core SDK or .NET Framework (depending on your project setup)
- Visual Studio 2019 or later for an optimal development experience

### Environment Setup Requirements
Make sure you have the GroupDocs.Signature library installed. You can set up this package through various methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Signature
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Signature" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial:** Start by downloading a free trial to test out GroupDocs.Signature.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license if you need more time to evaluate before purchasing.
- **Purchase:** If satisfied, purchase a license for long-term use from [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with C# programming and basic understanding of .NET application development will be helpful.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Signature, let's walk through the installation process. Once installed, you'll need to initialize the library in your project.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
After installing via NuGet or CLI, add the following code snippet at the start of your application to initialize GroupDocs.Signature:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature;
```

Set up a basic signature configuration with this setup:

```csharp
var signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH");
```

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH"` with the path to the document you intend to sign.

## Implementation Guide

### Sign Document with Text Watermark

Now, let's dive into how we can sign a document using text as a watermark. This feature not only helps in verifying authenticity but also provides an aesthetically pleasing way to include necessary information.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Document
Start by loading the document you wish to sign:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
```

#### Step 2: Configure Text Watermark Options

Define the text watermark options, including its appearance and location on the document.

```csharp
var options = new SignTextOptions("Confidential")
{
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,
    Width = 200,
    Height = 50,
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Arial" },
    ForeColor = Color.BlueViolet,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Yellow
};
```

#### Step 3: Apply the Watermark

Use the `Sign` method to apply your configured watermark to the document.

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", fileName);
signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

This code snippet places a "Confidential" text watermark on your document. The parameters like `Left`, `Top`, and font settings determine its appearance and position.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue:** Watermark not visible
  - **Solution:** Check your font size or color contrast settings.
  
- **Issue:** Application crashes with large documents
  - **Solution:** Ensure adequate memory allocation for processing.

## Practical Applications

1. **Contract Management Systems:** Securely sign contracts with personalized watermarks indicating approval status.
2. **Document Tracking:** Use unique watermarks to track document versions and distribution channels.
3. **Legal Firms:** Enhance document confidentiality by applying firm-specific watermark signatures.

Integrating GroupDocs.Signature can streamline these processes across various systems, enhancing security and efficiency.

## Performance Considerations

### Tips for Optimizing Performance
- Optimize document size before processing to reduce memory load.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to enhance performance in multi-user environments.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
Keep an eye on your application's resource usage. Efficient handling of resources ensures smooth operation, especially when dealing with large files or bulk processing tasks.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
Dispose of objects appropriately and consider using `using` statements to manage the lifecycle of resources efficiently.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to implement text watermarks in documents using GroupDocs.Signature for .NET. This feature not only secures your documents but also adds a professional touch with customizable options.
