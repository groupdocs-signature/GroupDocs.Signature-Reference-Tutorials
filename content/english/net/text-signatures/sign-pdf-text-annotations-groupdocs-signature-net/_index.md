## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s get into the core feature: signing a PDF using text annotations.

### Sign Document with Text Annotation

#### Overview:
This section demonstrates how to add a digital signature in the form of a text annotation on your PDF document. This functionality is ideal for scenarios where you need to visually indicate signed sections within documents.

##### Step 1: Set Up Signature Options
Start by configuring your text signature options, defining parameters like location and appearance:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Signature.Options;
using System.Drawing;

// Configure Text Signature options
var signOptions = new SignTextOptions("John Doe")
{
    // Specify the position for the signature on the page
    Left = 100,
    Top = 100,

    // Customize appearance
    Font = new SignatureFont { Size = 12, FamilyName = "Arial" },
    ForeColor = Color.BlueViolet,

    // Set alignment and other properties
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Bottom
};
```

##### Step 2: Sign the Document
Execute the signing process by passing your document path and signature options:

```csharp
// Apply text annotation to sign the PDF
signature.Sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signed_sample.pdf", signOptions);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a visually appealing signature using customizable text annotations. The `SignTextOptions` class allows you to specify various parameters like font size, color, and position.

##### Key Configuration Options:
- **Font Size and Family**: Adjust the readability and style of your signature.
