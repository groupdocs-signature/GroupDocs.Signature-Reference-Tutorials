# How to Sign a PDF with Metadata Using GroupDocs.Signature for Java

In today's digital landscape, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of documents is crucial. If you're dealing with PDFs that require a layer of security via signatures, this tutorial will guide you through signing a PDF document using metadata such as author name, creation date, document ID, and signature ID with GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up your environment for PDF signing
- Adding metadata like author name, creation date, document ID, and signature ID
- Signing a PDF document programmatically using GroupDocs.Signature

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we start implementing this feature.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
You'll need to include GroupDocs.Signature in your project. You can do this through Maven or Gradle.

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure that your development environment is set up with:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with Java programming concepts and basic understanding of PDF document structures will be helpful.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To start using GroupDocs.Signature, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Use Maven or Gradle as shown above to include the library in your project.
2. **License Acquisition:**
   - You can obtain a free trial version from [GroupDocs.Signature downloads](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).
   - For extended usage, consider applying for a temporary license via [GroupDocs' temporary license page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Basic Initialization and Setup:**
   - Begin by importing the necessary packages:
     ```java
     import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
     import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.signatures.metadata.PdfMetadataSignature;
     import com.groupdocs.signature.exception.GroupDocsSignatureException;
     import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.MetadataSignOptions;
     ```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's walk through the steps to implement PDF signing with metadata.

### Adding Metadata Signatures

The primary functionality here is to sign a PDF using metadata. This involves setting up signatures such as author name and creation date.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Document Path
Define paths for your input PDF and output directory.
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF"; // Replace SAMPLE_PDF with your actual file name.
String fileName = Paths.get(filePath).getFileName().toString();
String outputFilePath = new File("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SignPdfWithMetadata/", fileName).getPath();
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Signature Object
Create a `Signature` object to handle signing operations.
```java
try {
    Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
    // This initializes the Signature instance with your source document path.
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new GroupDocsSignatureException(e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Step 3: Define Metadata Signatures
Set up metadata using `PdfMetadataSignature` objects for each attribute you wish to sign.
```java
MetadataSignOptions options = new MetadataSignOptions();

PdfMetadataSignature[] signatures = new PdfMetadataSignature[]{
    new PdfMetadataSignature("Author", "Mr.Sherlock Holmes"), // Set Author metadata.
    new PdfMetadataSignature("DateCreated", new Date()),      // Set creation date to current date.
    new PdfMetadataSignature("DocumentId", 123456),          // Assign a unique document ID.
    new PdfMetadataSignature("SignatureId", 123.456)         // Define a decimal signature ID.
};

options.getSignatures().addRange(signatures);
```

#### Step 4: Sign the Document
Finally, use the `sign` method to apply your metadata signatures and save the signed PDF.
```java
signature.sign(outputFilePath, options); // This will sign the document with specified metadata.
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new GroupDocsSignatureException(e.getMessage());
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that file paths are correctly set up to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Validate your metadata values, especially if they have specific format requirements.

## Practical Applications

This feature is highly beneficial in scenarios such as:
- **Contract Management:** Automatically signing contracts with relevant metadata for legal compliance.
- **Document Version Control:** Tracking document creation and modification dates.
- **Automated Reporting Systems:** Embedding unique IDs to track reports through different stages of processing.

Integration with systems like CRM or ERP can streamline workflows by ensuring documents are signed with consistent metadata.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:
- Manage memory efficiently, especially if handling large volumes of PDFs. Use try-with-resources to ensure resources are freed.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks when signing multiple documents concurrently.

## Conclusion
