### License Acquisition:
- **Free Trial**: Explore features with a temporary license.
- **Temporary License**: Available to test before purchase.
- **Purchase**: For long-term projects, consider buying a full license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup:

To get started, initialize the `Signature` object by specifying your document's file path. This will be your gateway to applying various signature options.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the implementation into manageable parts, ensuring each feature is clearly understood and effectively utilized.

### Metadata Signing in Word Documents

#### Overview:
Metadata signing allows you to embed essential information directly within a document's metadata fields. This process enhances security by embedding details like authorship and creation date.

**Step 1: Define Document Paths**

Start by setting the file paths for both your input and output documents.
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx"; // Update with actual file path
String fileName = Paths.get(filePath).getFileName().toString();
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SignWordWithMetadata/" + fileName;
```

**Step 2: Initialize Signature Object**

Create a `Signature` object to handle the document you wish to sign.
```java
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**Step 3: Configure Metadata Sign Options**

Set up options for signing metadata by creating an instance of `MetadataSignOptions`.
```java
MetadataSignOptions options = new MetadataSignOptions();
```

**Step 4: Create and Add Metadata Signatures**

Define the metadata you want to include, such as author and creation date.
```java
WordProcessingMetadataSignature[] signatures = {
    new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("Author", "Mr.Scherlock Holmes"), // Set the author
    new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("DateCreated", new Date()), // Set creation date
    new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("DocumentId", 123456), // Unique document ID
    new WordProcessingMetadataSignature("SignatureId", 123.456) // Signature ID
};
options.getSignatures().addRange(signatures);
```

**Step 5: Sign the Document**

Execute the signing process and save the signed document to your specified output path.
```java
signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure correct file paths are set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that all dependencies are properly configured in your build tool.

## Practical Applications

Metadata signing is not just limited to security; it finds applications across various industries:

1. **Legal Documentation**: Ensuring the authenticity of contracts and agreements.
2. **Business Reports**: Embedding authorship and revision history for accountability.
3. **Academic Papers**: Verifying publication details in research documents.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents or batches, consider these optimizations:
- Monitor memory usage to prevent leaks.
- Optimize I/O operations by managing file streams efficiently.
- Utilize GroupDocs' asynchronous signing features where applicable.

## Conclusion

You've now mastered the art of metadata signing in Word documents using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. This powerful feature not only secures your documents but also ensures their integrity and authenticity.

### Next Steps:
Explore further functionalities within the GroupDocs library, such as digital signature verification or batch processing capabilities.
