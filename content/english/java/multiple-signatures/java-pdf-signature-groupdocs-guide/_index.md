- The steps to include a barcode signature in your documents
- Techniques for embedding QR code signatures
- Methods for applying digital signatures with visual representation

Let's begin by setting up the necessary prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing GroupDocs.Signature for Java, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
1. **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**: Ensure you are using version 23.12 or later.
2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher is recommended.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- Maven or Gradle build tools installed on your machine.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with Java programming and a basic understanding of PDF manipulation can be beneficial. However, this guide will walk you through each step in detail.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To start using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, add it as a dependency to your project. Below are instructions for different build tools:

### Maven
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Include this in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Access a 30-day free trial to explore all features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Buy the full version if you're ready to deploy in production.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Start by initializing the `Signature` class with your document's path. Here’s a simple setup:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into adding different types of signatures to your PDFs using GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

### Text Signature
**Overview:** A text signature adds a handwritten or typed name within your document. It’s ideal for personalizing documents quickly.

#### Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize the Signature Object**
   ```java
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```
2. **Create TextSignOptions**
   ```java
   TextSignOptions textOptions = new TextSignOptions("This is a test message");
   ```
3. **Configure Alignment Options**
   ```java
   textOptions.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top); // Top alignment
   textOptions.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left); // Left alignment
   ```
4. **Add the Signature to the Document**
   ```java
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, textOptions);
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct.
- Verify that you have write permissions for the output directory.

### Barcode Signature
**Overview:** A barcode signature embeds a unique code within your document. It's perfect for tracking and authentication purposes.

#### Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize the Signature Object**
   ```java
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```
2. **Create BarcodeSignOptions**
   ```java
   BarcodeSignOptions barcodeOptions = new BarcodeSignOptions("123456");
   barcodeOptions.setEncodeType(BarcodeTypes.Code128); // Set to Code128 type
   ```
3. **Position the Barcode**
   ```java
   barcodeOptions.setLeft(100);
   barcodeOptions.setTop(100);
   ```
4. **Add the Signature to the Document**
   ```java
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, barcodeOptions);
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Check for compatibility of barcode types with your document.
- Ensure accurate positioning to avoid overlap with existing content.

### QR Code Signature
**Overview:** QR codes are versatile and can store a lot of information. They're useful for quick data retrieval and verification.

#### Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize the Signature Object**
   ```java
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```
2. **Create QrCodeSignOptions**
   ```java
   QrCodeSignOptions qrcodeOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith");
   qrcodeOptions.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR); // Use QR type
   ```
3. **Set Positioning**
   ```java
   qrcodeOptions.setLeft(100);
   qrcodeOptions.setTop(200);
   ```
4. **Add the Signature to the Document**
   ```java
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, qrcodeOptions);
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the QR code content is not too large.
- Verify that the positioning does not interfere with critical document areas.

### Digital Signature
**Overview:** A digital signature provides a secure method of signing documents electronically. It includes verification capabilities and can be visually customized.

#### Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize the Signature Object**
   ```java
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```
2. **Create DigitalSignOptions**
   ```java
   DigitalSignOptions digitalOptions = new DigitalSignOptions("path/to/certificate.pfx");
   digitalOptions.setImageFilePath("path/to/signature/image.png"); // Optional image path
   ```
3. **Configure Alignment and Access**
   ```java
   digitalOptions.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);
   digitalOptions.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
   digitalOptions.setPassword("1234567890");
   ```
4. **Add the Signature to the Document**
   ```java
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, digitalOptions);
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your certificate file is accessible and not corrupted.
- Double-check the password for accessing the certificate.
