# Implement Document Verification with Event Subscription Using GroupDocs.Signature for Java

## Introduction

Enhancing your document verification processes is essential, especially when dealing with large volumes or sensitive information. GroupDocs.Signature for Java simplifies this task by allowing seamless integration of event subscriptions during the verification process. This tutorial guides you through setting up and subscribing to events in a document verification workflow using text signature options.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature in your Java environment
- Implementing event subscription for document verification
- Verifying documents with specific text signatures
- Real-world applications of these features

Let's dive into the prerequisites you need before we start implementing these features!

## Prerequisites

To follow along, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Java 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- **Maven/Gradle:** Use Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
- **Basic Java Knowledge:** Familiarity with Java programming and IDE usage.

### Required Libraries

For this tutorial, we will use GroupDocs.Signature version 23.12. Hereâ€™s how to include it in your project:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition

- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs.Signature features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license if you need extended access.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a license for long-term use.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To kickstart your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Library**: Use Maven or Gradle as shown above to add GroupDocs.Signature to your project dependencies.
2. **Basic Initialization**:
   - Create an instance of the `Signature` class by passing the document path.
   - This sets up your environment for performing signature operations.

Here's a simple initialization example:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

public class SetupGroupDocs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
        Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
        // Additional setup can be done here.
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Event Subscription for Verification Process

**Overview**: By subscribing to events, you can track the progress and outcome of your document verification. This helps in logging or reacting dynamically based on the verification status.

#### Subscribing to Events

##### Step 1: Define Event Handlers

Define event handlers for when the verification process starts, progresses, and completes:

```java
private static void onVerifyStarted(Signature sender, ProcessStartEventArgs args) {
    System.out.println("Verification started.");
}

private static void onVerifyProgress(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args) {
    System.out.println("Verification progress: " + args.getProgress() + "%");
}

private static void onVerifyCompleted(Signature sender, ProcessCompleteEventArgs args) {
    System.out.println("Verification completed. Result: " + args.getVerificationResult().isValid());
}
```

##### Step 2: Subscribe to Events

Use the `add` method to subscribe to each event:

```java
void setupAndSubscribeEvents() throws GroupDocsSignatureException {
    String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
    Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
    
    // Subscribe to events
    signature.VerifyStarted.add(new ProcessStartEventHandler() {
        public void invoke(Signature sender, ProcessStartEventArgs args) {
            onVerifyStarted(sender, args);
        }
    });

    signature.VerifyProgress.add(new ProcessProgressEventHandler() {
        public void invoke(Signature sender, ProcessProgressEventArgs args) {
            onVerifyProgress(sender, args);
        }
    });

    signature.VerifyCompleted.add(new ProcessCompleteEventHandler() {
        public void invoke(Signature sender, ProcessCompleteEventArgs args) {
            onVerifyCompleted(sender, args);
        }
    });
}
```

### Feature 2: Verification with Text Signature Options

**Overview**: Verify documents by checking for specific text signatures. This feature is useful when you need to ensure certain texts are present across all pages.

#### Verifying a Document

##### Step 1: Set Up Text Verification Options

Create `TextVerifyOptions` and set the necessary parameters:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.verify.TextVerifyOptions;

void verifyDocumentWithTextSignature() throws GroupDocsSignatureException {
    String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
    Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);

    TextVerifyOptions options = new TextVerifyOptions("John Smith");
    options.setAllPages(true);  // Verify all pages
}
```

##### Step 2: Execute the Verification

Perform the verification and handle the result:

```java
VerificationResult result = signature.verify(options);
if (result.isValid()) {
    System.out.println("Document is valid.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Document validation failed.");
}
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Legal Document Review**: Verify contracts to ensure they contain required signatures or clauses.
2. **Educational Assessments**: Ensure all submitted assignments have the correct student identifiers.
3. **Medical Records**: Validate that patient records include necessary doctor's notes and approvals.

Integration with existing systems can be achieved by adapting these event handlers to log results into databases or trigger alerts in monitoring dashboards.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Limit the number of concurrent verifications if working with large documents.
- **Memory Management**: Ensure proper handling of resources, especially when processing multiple files simultaneously.

## Conclusion
