### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java
To integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your project, you can use either Maven or Gradle. Here’s how:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Access a free trial to test GroupDocs.Signature features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Buy a full license for commercial use.

## Implementation Guide
Let’s break down the implementation into manageable sections, each focusing on a specific feature of GroupDocs.Signature.

### Initialize Signature Object
**Overview:**
Initializing a `Signature` object is your first step towards managing signatures in Java. This allows you to work with documents and apply various signature-related operations.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your File Path
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

public class InitializeSignature {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
        
        // Create a Signature object using the file path
        final Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
        // The Signature object is now ready for further operations.
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"` with your actual document path. This initializes the `Signature` object, preparing it for tasks like searching or deleting signatures.

### Search for Barcode Signatures
**Overview:**
Searching for barcode signatures in a document is essential for verification and validation processes.

#### Step 2: Configure Search Options
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.signatures.BarcodeSignature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.search.BarcodeSearchOptions;

public class SearchBarcodeSignatures {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
        
        final Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
        
        // Create search options for barcode signatures
        BarcodeSearchOptions options = new BarcodeSearchOptions();
        
        // Search for barcode signatures in the document
        List<BarcodeSignature> signatures = signature.search(BarcodeSignature.class, options);
        if (!signatures.isEmpty()) {
            // Access found barcode signatures from the 'signatures' list.
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** The `BarcodeSearchOptions` class configures how the search is conducted. Adjust these settings based on your specific requirements.

### Delete Barcode Signature
**Overview:**
Removing a specific barcode signature can be necessary for document updates or corrections.

#### Step 3: Identify and Remove the Signature
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.signatures.BarcodeSignature;
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteBarcode {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
        
        final Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
        
        BarcodeSearchOptions options = new BarcodeSearchOptions();
        
        List<BarcodeSignature> signatures = signature.search(BarcodeSignature.class, options);
        if (!signatures.isEmpty()) {
            BarcodeSignature barcodeSignature = signatures.get(0);
            
            String outputFilePath = new File("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output_sample.pdf").getPath();
            
            // Delete the first found barcode signature from the document
            boolean result = signature.delete(outputFilePath, barcodeSignature);
            if (result) {
                // Signature successfully deleted.
            } else {
                // Could not find or delete the signature.
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This code identifies and deletes the first barcode signature found. Ensure `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` is set to your desired output path.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Signature can be used in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Contract Management**: Automate the verification of signed contracts.
2. **Invoice Processing**: Validate invoices with embedded barcodes.
