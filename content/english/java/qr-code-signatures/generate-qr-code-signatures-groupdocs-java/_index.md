## Prerequisites

Before using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Libraries & Dependencies**: Install necessary libraries. Use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.
  
  **Maven**
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
      <version>23.12</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

  **Gradle**
  ```gradle
  implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
  ```

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a Java development environment with JDK and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Java programming concepts is essential, as well as understanding digital signatures.

Next, we will guide you through setting up GroupDocs.Signature for Java in your project environment.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To start using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Use Maven or Gradle to include the dependency as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**:
   - Begin with a free trial version by downloading it from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).
   - For extended use, consider purchasing a license or applying for a temporary one through their [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
3. **Basic Initialization**:
   Initialize the library in your Java application to start using its features.

   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
   
   // Initialize Signature object
   Signature signature = new Signature("sample.pdf");
   ```

With GroupDocs.Signature for Java configured, you're ready to generate QR Code signatures. Let's delve into the specifics.

## Implementation Guide

### Generating a QR Code Signature

Creating QR code signatures involves several key steps. Each step helps customize how data is embedded and displayed within your documents.

#### Overview
QR Code signatures are versatile; they allow you to embed complex information such as addresses, URLs, or binary data directly into your documents. Let's see how to generate these signatures with specific alignment settings using GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Configure QR Code Options
Begin by setting up the `QrCodeSignOptions` object. This is where you specify the type of QR code and the data it should contain.

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.VerticalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions.serialization.Address;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.qrcodes.QrCodeTypes;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.QrCodeSignOptions;

QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions();
signOptions.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);

// Setup data with an Address object
Address address = new Address();
address.setStreet("221B Baker Street");
address.setCity("London");
address.setState("NW");
address.setZIP("NW16XE");
address.setCountry("England");

signOptions.setData(address);
```
**Explanation**: Here, we set the QR code type to standard `QR` and fill it with address information. This data encapsulation ensures that important details are readily available within your document.

##### 2. Align the QR Code
Adjust alignment settings to control where the QR code appears on the document page.

```java
signOptions.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left);
signOptions.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);
signOptions.setWidth(100);
signOptions.setHeight(100);
```
**Explanation**: Alignment options (`HorizontalAlignment` and `VerticalAlignment`) allow you to position your QR code precisely. This step ensures that the QR code is both aesthetically pleasing and strategically placed for optimal scanning.

##### 3. Set Margins
Define margins around the QR code to ensure it doesn't touch the edges of the document, which can be important for scanning reliability.

```java
signOptions.setMargin(new Padding(10));
```
**Explanation**: A margin is set here using `Padding`, ensuring that there's space between your QR code and the document edge, improving scanability.

### Configuring Signature Preview Options

Setting up preview options allows you to visualize how the signature will appear before finalizing it. Here's how:

#### Overview
Preview settings are crucial for verifying the appearance of your signatures within documents.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Create and Configure PreviewOptions
Utilize `PreviewSignatureOptions` to define how the signature will be previewed.

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.PreviewSignatureOptions;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.preview.PreviewFormats;
import java.util.UUID;

PreviewSignatureOptions previewOption = new PreviewSignatureOptions(signOptions);
previewOption.setSignatureId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
previewOption.setPreviewFormat(PreviewFormats.JPEG);
```
**Explanation**: The `PreviewSignatureOptions` object is configured to generate a JPEG preview of the QR code. A unique identifier for each signature (`UUID`) ensures that you can track and manage multiple signatures efficiently.

### Generating a Signature Stream

Generating a stream ensures your signed document is properly saved or transmitted.

#### Overview
Creating a file stream allows seamless handling of the signed document, ensuring it's stored correctly in specified directories.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Define Output Directory and Generate Stream
Ensure that the output directory exists before generating the stream to avoid errors during file writing.

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public OutputStream generateSignatureStream(PreviewSignatureOptions previewOptions) {
    try {
        Path path = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
        if (!Files.exists(path)) {
            Files.createDirectories(path);
        }
        
        // Create an output stream to save the signed document
        return new FileOutputStream(path.resolve("signedDocument.pdf"));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: This method checks if the specified directory exists and creates it if necessary, then returns a file output stream for saving your document. Handling directories ensures that the signed documents are stored in an organized manner.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to generate QR code signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, enhancing both security and flexibility in embedding additional data within your documents. With these steps, you can confidently implement digital signature functionalities in your Java applications.
