# How to Add QR Codes to PDF Documents in Java (With Secure Signing)

## Introduction

Ever needed to add scannable verification codes to your PDFs? Whether you're building an invoice system, creating certificates, or implementing document tracking, QR codes offer a powerful way to embed verifiable data directly into your documents.

Here's the challenge: you need more than just a pretty QR code image slapped onto a PDF. You need secure, tamper-proof signatures that embed custom data, support encryption, and work reliably across different document types. That's where programmatic QR code signing comes in.

In this guide, you'll learn how to add QR codes to PDF documents in Java using GroupDocs.Signature—a library that handles the heavy lifting of document manipulation, signature placement, and data encryption. We'll cover everything from basic QR code generation to advanced features like custom data encryption and production-ready configurations.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to generate and embed QR codes in PDF documents programmatically
- Creating custom signature data classes with metadata (IDs, timestamps, author info)
- Configuring QR code appearance, size, and positioning
- Implementing custom encryption for secure data storage
- Best practices for production deployment and troubleshooting

Whether you're building an enterprise document management system or just need to add verification codes to generated reports, this guide will get you up and running quickly.

## Why Use QR Codes for Document Signing?

Before diving into the implementation, let's talk about why QR codes are particularly useful for document authentication (and when they might not be the best choice).

**Key Benefits:**
- **Scannable Verification**: Anyone with a smartphone can instantly verify document authenticity
- **Embedded Metadata**: Store signing timestamps, author information, document IDs, and custom data
- **Offline Capability**: QR codes work without internet connectivity—useful for physical documents
- **Space Efficient**: Compact visual representation that doesn't clutter your documents
- **Universal Support**: Works across all platforms and devices with camera access

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Medical records that need tamper-proof patient identification
- Legal contracts requiring verifiable signing timestamps
- Educational certificates with institution verification
- Supply chain documents with shipment tracking data
- Financial reports with audit trail information

The beauty of this approach? You're not just adding a decorative code—you're embedding a complete data signature that can include encrypted information, making forgery significantly harder.

## Prerequisites

Let's make sure you've got everything set up before we start coding.

### Required Libraries and Versions

You'll need GroupDocs.Signature for Java. Add it to your project using Maven or Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signation:23.12'
```

Alternatively, download directly from [GroupDocs.Signature releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) if you prefer manual installation.

### Environment Setup Requirements

Here's what you need in your development environment:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher (JDK 11+ recommended for better performance)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 6.0+
- **Sample Documents**: Have some PDF files ready for testing

### Knowledge Prerequisites

This guide assumes you're comfortable with:
- Basic Java programming (classes, objects, methods)
- Working with Maven or Gradle dependencies
- Understanding of what QR codes are (though not how to implement them—we'll cover that!)

No prior experience with GroupDocs or document signing libraries is required. We'll explain everything as we go.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

Once you've added the dependency, initializing GroupDocs.Signature in your project is straightforward. Here's the basic setup:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

class InitializeGroupDocs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Signature signature = new Signature("path/to/your/document.pdf");
        // You can now start using the signature object to work with documents.
    }
}
```

**What's happening here?** The `Signature` class is your main entry point for all document operations. When you instantiate it with a file path, GroupDocs loads the document into memory and prepares it for manipulation. Think of it as opening a document in your application—except programmatically.

### License Acquisition Steps

GroupDocs offers flexible licensing options depending on your needs:

- **Free Trial**: Full feature access with some limitations (watermarks on output). Perfect for evaluation.
- **Temporary License**: Get a 30-day license without limitations for thorough testing. Request it from [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Commercial License**: Purchase for production use. Pricing varies based on deployment type (single developer, site license, etc.).

**Pro Tip**: Start with the free trial to validate the library works for your use case, then grab a temporary license for building your production implementation. Only purchase once you've confirmed everything works in your specific environment.

## Implementation Guide: Building Your QR Code Signing System

Now for the fun part—let's build this thing step by step. We'll start with creating a custom data structure for your signatures, then configure how QR codes look, and finally implement the actual signing with encryption.

### Step 1: Custom Data Signature Class

First, you need a way to structure the data that goes into your QR code. This isn't just about storing a simple string—you want metadata like who signed it, when, and any custom identifiers.

#### Why Create a Custom Class?

Think of this class as your signature's DNA. Every signed document will embed this data, making it possible to verify authenticity later. By using a structured class (rather than just cramming text into a QR code), you get:
- Type safety and validation
- Easy serialization to QR-compatible formats
- Clear documentation of what data you're storing
- Flexibility to add fields later without breaking existing signatures

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

Here's how to build a robust signature data class:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions.serialization.FormatAttribute;
import java.util.Date;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

class DocumentSignatureData {
    @FormatAttribute(propertyName = "SignID")
    public String ID; // Unique identifier for the signature
    
    public String getID() { return ID; }
    public void setID(String value) { ID = value; }
    
    @FormatAttribute(propertyName = "SAuth")
    public final String Author; // Author of the document
    
    public final String getAuthor() { return Author; }
    public final void setAuthor(String value) { Author = value; }
    
    @FormatAttribute(propertyName = "SDate", propertyFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd")
    public final Date Signed = new Date(); // Signing date and time
    
    public final Date getSigned() { return Signed; }
    public final void setSigned(Date value) { Signed = value; }
    
    @FormatAttribute(propertyName = "SDFact", propertyFormat = "N2")
    public final BigDecimal DataFactor = new BigDecimal(0.01); // Additional data factor for signature
    
    public final BigDecimal getDataFactor() { return DataFactor; }
    public final void setDataFactor(BigDecimal value) { DataFactor = value; }
}
```

**Breaking Down the Code:**

- **@FormatAttribute**: This annotation tells GroupDocs how to serialize your data. The `propertyName` defines the key used in the QR code's encoded data, while `propertyFormat` specifies formatting rules (like date patterns or decimal precision).

- **ID Field**: A unique identifier (typically a UUID) that makes each signature distinguishable. Critical for tracking and verification systems.

- **Author Field**: Captures who signed the document. You'll typically pull this from your authentication system or environment variables.

- **Signed Field**: Timestamp of when the signature was created. Note the date format specification—this ensures consistent date representation across different locales.

- **DataFactor Field**: This is your wild card—use it for whatever additional numeric data you need (version numbers, confidence scores, etc.). The "N2" format means it'll be stored with two decimal places.

**Common Customizations:**
You might want to add fields like `documentType`, `organizationID`, `securityLevel`, or `verificationURL` depending on your use case. Just remember: more data means larger QR codes, so balance information needs with scannability.

### Step 2: QR Code Sign Options Configuration

Now that you've got your data structure, you need to tell GroupDocs where to place the QR code and how it should look. This is where `QrCodeSignOptions` comes in.

#### Understanding Sign Options

Think of sign options as your design specifications. You're telling the library:
- "Put the QR code in the bottom-right corner"
- "Make it 100x100 pixels"
- "Leave some padding so it doesn't touch the edge"
- "Use the QR encoding type (not Aztec or DataMatrix)"

Getting these settings right is crucial because QR code scannability depends on proper sizing and contrast with the background.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.VerticalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.qrcodes.QrCodeTypes;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.Padding;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.QrCodeSignOptions;

class QrCodeSignOptionsConfig {
    public static QrCodeSignOptions setupQrCodeSignOptions(DocumentSignatureData documentSignature) {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions();
        
        // Serialize the custom data object into QR code
        options.setData(documentSignature);
        
        // Specify QR code type
        options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
        
        // Configure padding for alignment
        Padding padding = new Padding();
        padding.setRight(10); // Right padding in pixels
        padding.setBottom(10); // Bottom padding in pixels
        options.setMargin(padding);
        
        // Define size and position of the QR code
        options.setHeight(100);
        options.setWidth(100);
        options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Bottom);
        options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
        
        return options;
    }
}
```

**Understanding Each Configuration:**

- **setData()**: This connects your custom data class to the QR code. GroupDocs automatically serializes your object based on those `@FormatAttribute` annotations we added earlier.

- **setEncodeType()**: QR codes come in different flavors (QR, DataMatrix, Aztec, etc.). Standard QR is the most universally supported, so stick with `QrCodeTypes.QR` unless you have specific requirements.

- **Padding**: These margins prevent your QR code from bleeding into the document edge, which can interfere with scanning. Think of it like safe margins in print design.

- **Height/Width**: Size matters! Too small and scanners can't read it; too large and it dominates the document. 100x100 pixels is a good starting point for standard documents, but you'll want to adjust based on:
  - Amount of data encoded (more data needs a larger code)
  - Expected scanning distance (larger for further away)
  - Document size and layout

- **Alignment**: Bottom-right is conventional (like a signature), but adjust based on your document layout. Options include:
  - Top/Bottom/Center for vertical
  - Left/Right/Center for horizontal

**Positioning Pro Tips:**
- For certificates: Top-right or bottom-right corners work best
- For invoices: Bottom-left near payment info is common
- For multi-page documents: Consider first page vs. last page placement
- Always test scannability on actual printed documents, not just screens

### Step 3: Document Signing with QR Code and Custom Encryption

Here's where everything comes together. You'll take your data class, configure your QR options, apply encryption, and sign the actual document. This is the core functionality that transforms a plain PDF into a verifiable, secure document.

#### Why Add Encryption?

Even though QR codes look like random noise to humans, they're easily decoded. If your signature contains sensitive information (like internal IDs, verification tokens, or personally identifiable information), you should encrypt it. This adds a critical security layer—someone can scan your QR code, but they can't read the data without your decryption key.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions.encryption.IDataEncryption;
import com.groupdocs.signature.exception.GroupDocsSignatureException;

import java.util.UUID;

class SignDocumentWithQRCode {
    public static void signDocument(String filePath, String outputFilePath) throws Exception {
        try {
            Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);

            // Custom XOR encryption strategy
            IDataEncryption encryption = new CustomXOREncryption();

            // Configure the custom document signature data object
            DocumentSignatureData documentSignature = new DocumentSignatureData();
            documentSignature.setID(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
            documentSignature.setAuthor(System.getenv("USERNAME"));
            documentSignature.setSigned(new Date());
            documentSignature.setDataFactor(new BigDecimal("11.22"));

            // Setup QR-Code options
            QrCodeSignOptions options = QrCodeSignOptionsConfig.setupQrCodeSignOptions(documentSignature);

            // Apply encryption to the data within the QR code
            options.setDataEncryption(encryption);

            // Sign and save the document
            signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new GroupDocsSignatureException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Walking Through the Code:**

1. **Initialize Signature Object**: Load your source document (PDF, DOCX, or any supported format).

2. **Setup Encryption**: `CustomXOREncryption` is a placeholder for your encryption implementation. GroupDocs provides a flexible interface (`IDataEncryption`) where you implement two methods: `encode()` and `decode()`. XOR encryption is simple but weak—for production, consider AES or another strong algorithm.

3. **Create Signature Data**: Notice how we're generating a unique ID with `UUID.randomUUID()`. This ensures every signature is distinguishable, even if signed by the same person at similar times. The author comes from environment variables (common in server environments) but you'd typically pull this from your auth system.

4. **Configure Options**: We're calling the helper method from Step 2, passing our data object. This returns fully configured sign options.

5. **Apply Encryption**: This is the critical security step. Before the data gets encoded into the QR code, it passes through your encryption algorithm. Anyone scanning the code will see encrypted gibberish without the decryption key.

6. **Sign Document**: The `sign()` method does the heavy lifting—it generates the QR code, embeds it in the document at the specified position, and saves the result to your output path.

**Important Notes About File Handling:**
- The source file (`filePath`) remains unchanged
- Output is written to `outputFilePath`—make sure this location is writable
- For in-place modification, you'd load the document, sign it to a temp location, then replace the original
- Always handle file I/O exceptions properly (we're rethrowing here, but you'd want better error handling in production)

## Common Use Cases for QR Code Document Signing

Let's talk about where this actually gets used in the real world. Understanding these scenarios will help you design your implementation to match your specific needs.

### 1. Certificate Generation and Verification
**Scenario**: You're building a training platform that issues certificates. Each certificate needs to be verifiable to prevent forgery.

**Implementation**: Embed a QR code containing the certificate ID, recipient name, issue date, and a cryptographic hash of the certificate content. When someone scans it, they can verify against your database that the certificate is legitimate.

### 2. Invoice Authentication
**Scenario**: Your invoicing system needs to ensure invoices haven't been tampered with after sending.

**Implementation**: Add a QR code with invoice number, total amount, issue date, and a verification hash. Recipients can scan to confirm they're looking at an authentic, unaltered invoice.

### 3. Document Tracking in Supply Chain
**Scenario**: Shipment documents need to be traceable across multiple checkpoints and organizations.

**Implementation**: Embed tracking IDs, origin/destination info, and timestamps. Each checkpoint scans and verifies, creating an audit trail without requiring all parties to access your central database.

### 4. Medical Records Authentication
**Scenario**: Healthcare providers need to verify patient records are current and authentic.

**Implementation**: QR codes can include patient identifiers (compliant with privacy regulations), record version, last update timestamp, and issuing facility. Critical for preventing use of outdated or forged medical documents.

### 5. Legal Document Verification
**Scenario**: Contracts need to prove when they were signed and by whom.

**Implementation**: Signatures with encrypted data including signer identity, timestamp, document hash, and witness information if applicable. Provides legally defensible proof of signing.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Building document signing systems inevitably leads to some head-scratching moments. Here are the most common issues developers run into and how to fix them quickly.

### QR Code Not Appearing on Document

**Symptoms**: Your code runs without errors, but when you open the output PDF, there's no QR code visible.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Size/Position Issues**: The QR code might be placed outside the visible document area. Try setting explicit page numbers and coordinates:
   ```java
   options.setPageNumber(1); // Explicitly target first page
   options.setLeft(50);  // Absolute positioning
   options.setTop(50);
   ```

2. **Color Contrast**: If your QR code color matches the background, it'll be invisible. Ensure sufficient contrast:
   ```java
   options.setForeColor(java.awt.Color.BLACK);
   options.setBackgroundColor(java.awt.Color.WHITE);
   ```

3. **Z-Index Overlap**: Other content might be covering your QR code. Try different alignment settings or increase the AllPagesAppearance option.

### QR Code Not Scannable

**Symptoms**: The QR code appears, but smartphones or scanners can't read it.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Too Much Data**: QR codes have capacity limits. If you're encoding large amounts of data, the code becomes too complex to scan reliably. Solution: reduce data size or increase QR code dimensions:
   ```java
   options.setHeight(150); // Increase from default 100
   options.setWidth(150);
   ```

2. **Insufficient Error Correction**: Add error correction to make codes more resilient:
   ```java
   // Error correction is typically set via QR code type configuration
   // Higher error correction = more redundancy = better scannability
   ```

3. **Poor Print Quality**: If scanning printed documents fails, ensure:
   - Print resolution is at least 300 DPI
   - QR code is at least 1x1 inch when printed
   - High contrast between code and background

### Encryption/Decryption Errors

**Symptoms**: Getting exceptions when trying to read or verify signed documents, or "corrupted data" errors.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Key Mismatch**: Encryption and decryption must use identical keys. Store keys securely and consistently:
   ```java
   // Bad: using different keys
   // Good: centralized key management
   String encryptionKey = getFromSecureKeystore("qr-signing-key");
   ```

2. **Character Encoding Issues**: Text encoding can cause decryption failures. Always specify encoding explicitly:
   ```java
   String data = new String(encryptedBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
   ```

3. **Data Corruption**: If the QR code gets damaged or altered, decryption fails. Implement validation before attempting decryption to provide better error messages.

### Document Not Saving Correctly

**Symptoms**: The signing process completes, but the output file is corrupted, empty, or can't be opened.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **File Path Issues**: Ensure output directory exists and is writable:
   ```java
   File outputDir = new File(outputFilePath).getParentFile();
   if (!outputDir.exists()) {
       outputDir.mkdirs();
   }
   ```

2. **Insufficient Permissions**: Your application needs write access to the output location. Check file system permissions.

3. **File Already Open**: If the output file is open in another application (like Adobe Reader), signing will fail. Close the file or use a different output path.

4. **Memory Constraints**: Large documents might exceed available memory. Consider processing documents in batches or increasing JVM heap size:
   ```bash
   java -Xmx2g -jar your-application.jar
   ```

### License-Related Errors

**Symptoms**: Watermarks on output, feature limitations, or "license not valid" exceptions.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **License Not Applied**: Ensure you're calling the license application code before using GroupDocs:
   ```java
   License license = new License();
   license.setLicense("path/to/GroupDocs.Signature.lic");
   ```

2. **License Path Incorrect**: Double-check the license file path. Using resources from classpath? Try:
   ```java
   license.setLicense(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/GroupDocs.Signature.lic"));
   ```

3. **Expired License**: Temporary licenses expire after 30 days. Check expiration dates and renew if necessary.

## Best Practices for Production Deployment

You've got it working locally—awesome! But before pushing to production, here are critical considerations to ensure your QR code signing system is robust, secure, and maintainable.

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Encryption**: The `CustomXOREncryption` example is for demonstration only. In production, implement AES-256 or another industry-standard algorithm:
   - Never use simple XOR encryption for sensitive data
   - Store encryption keys in secure key management systems (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Rotate keys periodically and maintain key version tracking

2. **Validate Input Data**: Before signing, validate all signature data:
   ```java
   if (documentSignature.getAuthor() == null || documentSignature.getAuthor().isEmpty()) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Author cannot be empty");
   }
   // Add similar validation for other fields
   ```

3. **Implement Access Controls**: Not everyone should be able to sign documents. Implement proper authentication and authorization:
   - Track who performed signing operations
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Log all signing activities for audit trails

4. **Secure Key Storage**: Never hardcode encryption keys in source code. Use environment variables, secure vaults, or configuration management systems.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Reuse Signature Objects**: Creating new `Signature` objects is expensive. Pool them when processing multiple documents:
   ```java
   // Instead of creating new Signature for each document
   // Consider object pooling for high-throughput scenarios
   ```

2. **Batch Processing**: When signing multiple documents, process them in batches rather than one-by-one to reduce I/O overhead.

3. **Async Operations**: For web applications, sign documents asynchronously to avoid blocking user requests:
   - Queue signing jobs
   - Process in background workers
   - Notify users when complete

4. **QR Code Size Optimization**: Balance data amount with QR code complexity:
   - Only include essential data
   - Use short identifiers where possible
   - Consider linking to external data rather than embedding everything

### Error Handling and Logging

1. **Comprehensive Exception Handling**: Don't just catch and rethrow. Provide meaningful error messages:
   ```java
   try {
       signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
   } catch (GroupDocsSignatureException e) {
       logger.error("Failed to sign document: " + filePath, e);
       // Implement fallback or retry logic
       throw new DocumentSigningException("Document signing failed", e);
   }
   ```

2. **Detailed Logging**: Log important events for troubleshooting:
   - Document path and size
   - Signature options used
   - Success/failure outcomes
   - Processing duration

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring for:
   - Signing failure rates
   - Processing times
   - Exception frequencies
   - Resource utilization

### Maintenance and Updates

1. **Version Control for Signatures**: Include version information in your signature data:
   ```java
   documentSignature.setVersion("2.0"); // Track signature format versions
   ```
   This makes it possible to evolve your signature format over time while maintaining backward compatibility.

2. **Regular Testing**: Implement automated tests that:
   - Verify QR codes are scannable after signing
   - Test encryption/decryption round-trips
   - Validate signature data integrity
   - Check different document formats and sizes

3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep GroupDocs.Signature updated to get security patches and new features. Check release notes before updating.

4. **Document Your Configuration**: Maintain clear documentation of:
   - QR code placement decisions and rationale
   - Encryption algorithms and key management procedures
   - Data fields included in signatures and their purposes
   - Verification procedures for signed documents

## When to Use QR Code Signatures (and When Not To)

QR code signatures are powerful, but they're not always the right solution. Here's a decision framework to help you choose wisely.

### Use QR Code Signatures When:

**✓ Physical Document Verification Is Important**
If documents will be printed and need to be verified without digital tools, QR codes shine. Anyone with a smartphone can verify authenticity on the spot.

**✓ You Need Offline Verification**
QR codes work without internet connectivity. The data is embedded right in the document, making them perfect for air-gapped environments or areas with poor connectivity.

**✓ Cross-Platform Compatibility Matters**
QR codes are universally supported. No proprietary readers or special software required—just a camera and a QR scanner app.

**✓ You Want Visible Verification**
Unlike digital signatures that are invisible to users, QR codes provide a clear, visible indicator that a document is signed and verifiable.

**✓ Space Allows**
QR codes need physical space on the document. If you have room and the visual element doesn't detract from usability, they're a great choice.

### Consider Alternative Approaches When:

**✗ Documents Must Remain Completely Unmodified**
QR codes add visible content to documents. If you need signing that's completely invisible, use digital signatures or metadata-based approaches.

**✗ Maximum Security Is Required**
While encryption helps, QR codes are ultimately visible and scannable by anyone. For highly sensitive documents, consider cryptographic signatures stored in document metadata.

**✗ You Need Standards Compliance**
Some industries require specific signature standards (like PAdES for PDFs). Verify QR code approaches meet your regulatory requirements.

**✗ Documents Are Purely Digital**
If documents will never be printed and you have a fully digital workflow, traditional digital signatures might be simpler and more appropriate.

**✗ Space Is Extremely Limited**
For documents where every pixel matters (like business cards or dense forms), QR codes might be too intrusive.

### Hybrid Approaches

Often, the best solution combines multiple techniques:
- **QR Code + Digital Signature**: QR for quick visual verification, digital signature for legal validity
- **QR Code + Watermark**: Visual verification plus tamper-evidence
- **QR Code + Blockchain**: Scannable verification with distributed ledger immutability

Choose based on your specific requirements, balancing security, usability, and compliance needs.

## Next Steps and Advanced Topics

You've now got a solid foundation for implementing QR code signatures in Java. Here's where to go from here to level up your implementation.

### Verification System Implementation

The other half of the equation is verifying signed documents. You'll want to build a verification service that:
- Scans QR codes from uploaded or scanned documents
- Decrypts the signature data
- Validates against your records (database, blockchain, etc.)
- Returns verification status and signature details

This typically involves building both a backend API and a mobile/web interface for scanning.

### Advanced Customization Options

GroupDocs.Signature offers extensive customization beyond what we've covered:
- Custom QR code colors and styling
- Transparency and blend modes
- Multiple signatures per document
- Dynamic positioning based on document content
- Different QR types (Aztec, DataMatrix, PDF417)

### Integration with Document Workflows

Consider how QR signing fits into your broader document management:
- Workflow automation (sign on upload, approval, etc.)
- Integration with cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)
- Email notification systems
- Document version control

### Exploring GroupDocs.Signature Features

Beyond QR codes, GroupDocs.Signature supports:
- Text signatures
- Image signatures
