# Load & Sign Password-Protected Docs with QR Code in Java

## How to Load and Sign a Password-Protected Document Using GroupDocs.Signature for Java

### Introduction
In today’s digital age, securing sensitive documents is crucial. Accessing these secured files should not be cumbersome. Developers face challenges in implementing secure yet user-friendly solutions. GroupDocs.Signature for Java offers a seamless way to handle password-protected documents by loading and signing them with QR-code signatures.

This tutorial explores how to use GroupDocs.Signature for Java to load a password-protected document and sign it using a QR code. You’ll learn:
- Setting up your environment for GroupDocs.Signature
- Loading a password-protected PDF file
- Signing documents with QR codes in Java

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped to integrate these functionalities into your applications.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before diving into the implementation:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE.
- **GroupDocs.Signature Library:** We will use version 23.12 of this library.

A basic understanding of Java programming and working with libraries is recommended to follow along smoothly.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java
To start using GroupDocs.Signature in your Java project, integrate the library into your build system. Here's how to do it with Maven or Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Visit [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) to directly download the library.

To acquire a license, consider:
- **Free Trial:** Test out the features without limitations.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain this from GroupDocs if you need more time to evaluate.
- **Purchase:** For full access and support, purchase a subscription.

#### Basic Initialization
Initialize your application with GroupDocs.Signature by configuring it in your Java project. This involves setting up your `Signature` object, which is the primary class for document signing operations.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load Password-Protected Document

#### Overview
Loading a password-protected document requires specifying the correct credentials to access its contents. GroupDocs.Signature simplifies this with its robust API.

#### Step-by-step Instructions

**Step 1:** Set Up Load Options
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.exception.GroupDocsSignatureException;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.loadoptions.LoadOptions;

public class FeatureLoadPasswordProtected {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        // Define the path to your document and load options with a password.
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF_SIGNED_PWD";
        LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
        loadOptions.setPassword("1234567890");  // Set your document's password here.

        try {
            Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions);
            System.out.println("Document loaded successfully.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new GroupDocsSignatureException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** 
- `LoadOptions` is configured with the document’s password, ensuring secure access to the file.
- The `Signature` object, initialized with both the file path and load options, handles loading the protected document.

#### Troubleshooting
Ensure that the correct file path and password are provided. If issues arise, check for exceptions thrown during initialization and address them accordingly.

### Feature 2: Sign Document with QR-Code Signature

#### Overview
Enhance your documents by adding a QR-code signature using GroupDocs.Signature. This feature allows you to encode information within the document itself.

#### Step-by-step Instructions

**Step 1:** Prepare Signing Options
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.qrcodes.QrCodeTypes;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.QrCodeSignOptions;

public class FeatureQrCodeSigning {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF_SIGNED_PWD";
        String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/LoadPasswordProtected/document_signed.pdf";

        LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
        loadOptions.setPassword("1234567890");  // Password for document loading.

        try {
            Signature signature = new Signature(filePath, loadOptions);
            QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith");
            options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
            options.setLeft(100);  
            options.setTop(100);

            signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new GroupDocsSignatureException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** 
- `QrCodeSignOptions` is set up with the text to encode and the QR code type.
- The position of the QR code on the document can be adjusted using the `setLeft` and `setTop` methods.

#### Troubleshooting
Verify that all configurations, such as file paths and encoding settings, are correct. Address any exceptions by checking the specific error messages provided during execution.
