```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SamplePresentation.pptx");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Sign Presentation with QR Code Signature

This feature enables you to sign a presentation using a QR code and save it in different formats.

#### Overview:
We’ll create a QR-code signature for the text "JohnSmith" and save it as a TIFF file. This process involves initializing the `Signature` object, setting up the `QrCodeSignOptions`, and specifying the output format using `PresentationSaveOptions`.

**Step 1: Initialize Signature Object**
Start by creating an instance of the `Signature` class:
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SamplePresentation.pptx");
```

**Step 2: Configure QR Code Sign Options**
Set up your QR code options with predefined text and specify the QR type:
```java
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith");
signOptions.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
signOptions.setLeft(100); // Set signature position on the page
signOptions.setTop(100);
```

**Step 3: Define Save Options**
Specify the output file format and other save options:
```java
PresentationSaveOptions saveOptions = new PresentationSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setFileFormat(PresentationSaveFileFormat.Tiff);
saveOptions.setOverwriteExistingFiles(true);
```

**Step 4: Sign and Save Document**
Execute the signing process with the specified options:
```java
signature.sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SamplePPSX.tiff", signOptions, saveOptions);
```

### Save Document with Specific Output File Format

This feature demonstrates saving a document in a specific format using `PresentationSaveOptions`.

#### Overview:
We’ll configure and execute saving the presentation in TIFF format without adding any signature data.

**Step 1: Initialize Signature Object**
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SamplePresentation.pptx");
```

**Step 2: Configure Save Options**
Set your desired file format using `PresentationSaveOptions`:
```java
PresentationSaveOptions saveOptions = new PresentationSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setFileFormat(PresentationSaveFileFormat.Tiff);
saveOptions.setOverwriteExistingFiles(true);
```

**Step 3: Execute Save Process**
Perform the saving operation with configured options:
```java
signature.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SamplePPSX.tiff", saveOptions);
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where signing presentations with QR codes can be beneficial:
1. **Legal Documentation:** Enhance document security in legal environments by embedding signatures.
2. **Corporate Presentations:** Secure internal documents shared among stakeholders.
3. **Educational Materials:** Validate authenticity of educational content distributed digitally.
4. **Marketing Campaigns:** Ensure marketing materials are authentic and tamper-proof.
5. **Integration with CRM Systems:** Incorporate into workflows for document management.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Optimize memory usage by managing large presentations efficiently.
- Use asynchronous processing where possible to avoid blocking operations.
- Monitor resource consumption, especially when dealing with high-volume signing tasks.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to sign presentations using QR codes and save them in different formats with GroupDocs.Signature for Java. By following the steps outlined above, you can securely authenticate your documents while maintaining flexibility in file management.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different signature types provided by GroupDocs.Signature.
- Explore additional configuration options available within `PresentationSaveOptions`.
