- Best practices for optimizing performance when working with digital signatures in Java.

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites before implementing these features!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment is correctly set up. This section outlines what you need to know and have installed:

### Required Libraries
You'll need the GroupDocs.Signature for Java library. It can be added to your project using Maven or Gradle. Ensure you are working with version 23.12 of the library.

#### Maven Dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle Implementation
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

### Direct Download
For those who prefer not to use a build tool, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your development environment is equipped with:
- JDK 8 or higher.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with Java programming and basic knowledge of handling files in Java will be beneficial but not mandatory. We'll guide you through each step for clarity.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

Setting up your project with GroupDocs.Signature is straightforward:

1. **Add the Dependency:**
   If using Maven or Gradle, add the dependency as shown above in the Prerequisites section.

2. **License Acquisition Steps:**
   - **Free Trial:** Start by downloading a free trial from [GroupDocs](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).
   - **Temporary License:** For extended testing without evaluation limitations, request a temporary license at [Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
   - **Purchase:** To use in production, consider purchasing a license from [Purchase GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

3. **Basic Initialization and Setup:**

Hereâ€™s an example of initialization:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

public class InitializeSignature {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Instantiate Signature object with the path to your document
        Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf");
        
        // Use this 'signature' object to perform various operations
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### QR Code Signature on Document

#### Overview:
Adding a QR code signature enhances security and verifies authenticity. This section shows how to sign a PDF with a QR code using GroupDocs.Signature.

##### Import Necessary Classes
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.QrCodeTypes;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.QrCodeSignOptions;
```

##### Set Up the Signature Object
Initialize your `Signature` object with the path to your PDF document:
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf");
```

##### Configure QR Code Options
Create and configure a `QrCodeSignOptions` instance. This includes setting the content of the QR code, its position on the page, and specifying it as a QR code type.
```java
QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith"); // Set the QR code content

signOptions.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR); // Specify QR code type
signOptions.setLeft(100); // X-coordinate for the signature's position
signOptions.setTop(100); // Y-coordinate for the signature's position
```

##### Sign and Save the Document
Use the `sign` method to apply the QR code signature and save it:
```java
signature.sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signedWithQRCode.png", signOptions);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your document path is correct.
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly added.

### Export Document as Image with Custom Border and Pages Setup

#### Overview:
This feature demonstrates exporting a signed PDF as an image, complete with custom borders and page configurations. It's perfect for presenting documents in visual formats.

##### Import Necessary Classes
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.Border;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.DashStyle;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.ImageSaveFileFormat;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.saveoptions.ExportImageSaveOptions;
import java.awt.Color;
```

##### Set Up the Signature Object
As before, initialize your `Signature` object with the document path:
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf");
```

##### Configure Export Options
Create an instance of `ExportImageSaveOptions`. Here, you can define image format, border properties, and page setup.
```java
ExportImageSaveOptions exportImageSaveOptions = new ExportImageSaveOptions(ImageSaveFileFormat.Png);

Border border = new Border();
border.setColor(Color.BLUE); // Set the border color to blue
border.setWeight(5); // Set the border width
border.setDashStyle(DashStyle.Solid); // Set dash style for the border
border.setTransparency(0.5); // Set border transparency

exportImageSaveOptions.setBorder(border);
exportImageSaveOptions.setPagesSetup(new PagesSetup());
exportImageSaveOptions.getPagesSetup().setFirstPage(true); // Export only the first page
exportImageSaveOptions.setPageColumns(2); // Set number of columns for layout
```

##### Sign and Save as Image
Apply the export options to save your document as an image:
```java
signature.sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signedAndSavedAsImage.png", null, exportImageSaveOptions);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Check the format compatibility of output files.
- Ensure that all customizations fit within the page dimensions.
