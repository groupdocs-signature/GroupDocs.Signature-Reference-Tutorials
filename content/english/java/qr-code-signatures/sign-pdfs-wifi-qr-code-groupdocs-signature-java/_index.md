# Add WiFi QR Code to PDF Java with GroupDocs.Signature

## Introduction

Ever handed someone a piece of paper with your WiFi password scribbled on it? Or worse, tried spelling out "WPA2-PSK-AES-2024!Security#" over the phone? There's a better way.

If you're managing conference venues, hotels, co-working spaces, or corporate offices, you're probably tired of the manual WiFi credential sharing process. Guests fumble with passwords, IT staff fields constant connectivity questions, and printed credentials pose security risks when they're left behind or photographed.

Here's the solution: **embed WiFi credentials directly into PDF documents as scannable QR codes**. Your welcome packets, event badges, or digital room keys can now include instant network access. Guests simply scan the QR code with their phones, and they're connected—no typing required.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to programmatically add WiFi QR codes to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. We'll cover everything from basic implementation to security considerations, with practical code examples you can use right away.

**What you'll accomplish:**
- Generate QR codes containing WiFi network credentials (SSID, password, encryption type)
- Embed these QR codes into existing PDF documents at precise positions
- Handle different WiFi encryption types (WPA, WPA2, WEP)
- Implement security best practices for credential distribution
- Troubleshoot common issues in production environments

Whether you're building an event management system, a hotel check-in app, or an internal office tool, this guide gives you everything you need to automate WiFi credential sharing securely and professionally.

## Prerequisites

Before you start coding, let's make sure you have everything in place.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

You'll need **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**, a comprehensive library designed for document signing operations. Here's how to add it to your project:

**For Maven users** (add to your `pom.xml`):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**For Gradle users** (add to your `build.gradle`):
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Manual installation**: If you're not using a dependency manager, download the JAR directly from the [GroupDocs releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) and add it to your project's classpath.

### Environment Setup Requirements

Make sure your development environment includes:

- **JDK 8 or higher** (JDK 11+ recommended for better performance)
- **Java IDE** like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans
- **PDF files** to test with (start with a simple single-page PDF)
- **Maven or Gradle** (optional but recommended for dependency management)

### Knowledge Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:
- **Java fundamentals** (classes, objects, methods)
- **Basic PDF concepts** (you don't need to be an expert, but understanding what a PDF is helps)
- **File I/O operations** in Java

Don't worry if you haven't worked with digital signatures before—we'll cover everything you need to know as we go.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

Let's get your project configured properly so everything runs smoothly.

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs.Signature requires a license for production use. Here are your options:

1. **Free trial**: Perfect for testing—get it from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/)
2. **Temporary license**: Need more time to evaluate? Get a 30-day temporary license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)
3. **Full license**: Ready for production? [Purchase here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/)

For development purposes, the trial version works great and includes all the features we'll use in this tutorial.

### Basic Project Initialization

Once you've added the dependency, let's initialize the Signature object. This is your main entry point for all document signing operations:

```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**Important note**: Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"` with the actual path to your PDF file. The file should exist before you run this code, or you'll get a `FileNotFoundException`.

**Pro tip**: Use relative paths or environment variables for file paths instead of hardcoding them. This makes your code more portable and easier to test across different environments.

That's it for setup! Now you're ready to start adding WiFi QR codes to your PDFs.

## Implementation Guide: Adding WiFi QR Codes to PDFs

Now for the fun part—let's build the actual functionality. We'll break this down into three clear steps that work together to create your WiFi-enabled PDF.

### Step 1: Create a WiFi Credentials Object

First, you need to encapsulate your network information into a WiFi object. Think of this as a container that holds all the details someone needs to connect to your network.

```java
WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
wifi.setSSID("GuestNetwork!");
wifi.setEncryption(WiFiEncryptionType.WPAWPA2);
wifi.setPassword("guest");
wifi.setHidden(false);
```

**What's happening here?**
- **SSID**: Your network name—exactly as it appears to users
- **Encryption**: The security protocol (WPA/WPA2 is most common; we'll discuss alternatives below)
- **Password**: The network password (keep this secure—more on that in Best Practices)
- **Hidden**: Whether the network broadcasts its SSID (`false` means visible, which is typical for guest networks)

**Common encryption types you can use:**
- `WiFiEncryptionType.WPAWPA2` - Most secure, works with modern devices
- `WiFiEncryptionType.WPA` - Older standard, still widely supported
- `WiFiEncryptionType.WEP` - Deprecated, avoid unless you're supporting very old devices
- `WiFiEncryptionType.NOPASS` - For open networks (not recommended for most use cases)

**Real-world consideration**: If you're managing a hotel or conference venue, you might be dynamically generating these credentials per room or per event. In that case, you'd pull this data from your database or credential management system rather than hardcoding it.

### Step 2: Configure QR Code Appearance and Position

Now let's tell GroupDocs exactly how and where to place the QR code on your PDF.

```java
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions();
options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
options.setData(wifi);
options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left);
options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);
options.setWidth(100);
options.setHeight(100);
options.setMargin(new Padding(10));
```

**Breaking down the options:**

- **EncodeType**: We're using standard QR codes (as opposed to barcodes or other formats)
- **Data**: This links our WiFi object to the QR code—the credentials get encoded into the scannable image
- **Alignment**: Position the QR code on your page (left-center works well for most layouts)
- **Size**: 100x100 pixels is a good balance between scannability and space usage
- **Margin**: 10-pixel padding prevents the QR code from touching other content

**Customization ideas for your use case:**
- **Certificates or badges**: Place QR code in the top-right corner with `HorizontalAlignment.Right` and `VerticalAlignment.Top`
- **Welcome packets**: Bottom-right corner often works well for multi-page documents
- **Room keys**: Center position (`HorizontalAlignment.Center`) creates a focal point

**Size considerations**: QR codes smaller than 75x75 pixels can be difficult to scan, especially in poor lighting. Anything larger than 150x150 might be overkill unless your PDF is poster-sized. Test with actual devices to find your sweet spot.

### Step 3: Sign the Document and Save

Finally, let's apply the QR code to your PDF and save the result.

```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signed_document_with_wifi_qrcode.pdf";
signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. GroupDocs reads your original PDF
2. Generates a QR code image from your WiFi credentials
3. Embeds the QR code at the specified position
4. Creates a new PDF file with the embedded QR code
5. Saves it to your specified output path

**Important**: The original PDF remains unchanged. You're creating a new, signed version with the QR code included.

**Performance note**: For a typical single-page PDF, this operation takes 500-1000ms. If you're batch-processing hundreds of documents, consider implementing parallel processing or a queue-based system.

That's the core implementation! With these three steps, you can now generate WiFi-enabled PDFs programmatically.

## When to Use WiFi QR Codes in PDFs

Not every situation calls for WiFi QR codes embedded in PDFs. Let's look at when this solution shines and when you might want to consider alternatives.

### Ideal Use Cases

**1. Event Management & Conferences**
Perfect for: Attendee badges, welcome packets, digital programs
Why it works: Participants receive their credentials ahead of time or at check-in, reducing congestion at help desks and allowing instant connectivity when they arrive.

**2. Hospitality & Hotels**
Perfect for: Room key packets, check-in documents, guest welcome letters
Why it works: Guests get seamless WiFi access without calling the front desk or searching for posted passwords. You can also generate unique credentials per room for better security tracking.

**3. Corporate Offices & Co-Working Spaces**
Perfect for: Visitor badges, contractor onboarding documents, guest access forms
Why it works: Temporary workers and visitors get immediate network access with appropriate security controls. IT doesn't need to manually provision each guest.

**4. Educational Institutions**
Perfect for: Student orientation packets, conference attendee materials, workshop handouts
Why it works: Large groups can connect simultaneously without overwhelming support staff with credential requests.

### When to Consider Alternatives

**Physical signage might be better if:**
- Your credentials change frequently (daily or weekly)
- You need to revoke access quickly
- Users don't have the PDF in advance (walk-in guests)

**NFC tags or physical cards work better when:**
- Your audience has NFC-enabled devices
- You want a more premium, tech-forward experience
- The credential needs to integrate with physical access control

**Web-based portals are preferable if:**
- You need detailed usage analytics
- Credentials should be time-limited or usage-limited
- You want to capture user acceptance of terms of service

**The PDF QR code approach excels when** you're distributing documents anyway and want to add connectivity as a value-add feature. It's low-tech, universally compatible (any smartphone can scan QR codes), and doesn't require additional infrastructure beyond what you're already creating.

## Customization Options for WiFi QR Codes

The basic implementation works great, but you might want to adjust the appearance or behavior based on your specific needs. Here's how to customize the existing features.

### Adjusting QR Code Size and Position

**Making the QR code larger for visibility:**
```java
options.setWidth(150);
options.setHeight(150);
```
Useful for printed materials where people scan from a distance.

**Positioning in different corners:**
```java
// Top-right corner
options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top);

// Bottom-center
options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Bottom);
```

**Adding more space around the QR code:**
```java
options.setMargin(new Padding(20, 20, 20, 20)); // top, right, bottom, left
```

### Working with Different WiFi Encryption Types

**Open network (no password):**
```java
WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
wifi.setSSID("PublicNetwork");
wifi.setEncryption(WiFiEncryptionType.NOPASS);
wifi.setHidden(false);
// No password needed
```

**Enterprise WPA with hidden SSID:**
```java
WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
wifi.setSSID("CorporateSecure");
wifi.setEncryption(WiFiEncryptionType.WPAWPA2);
wifi.setPassword("complexP@ssw0rd!");
wifi.setHidden(true);  // Network won't appear in scan lists
```

**Supporting legacy devices with WEP:**
```java
wifi.setEncryption(WiFiEncryptionType.WEP);
```
(Though WEP is insecure and should only be used if absolutely necessary for compatibility)

### Handling Multiple Pages

If your PDF has multiple pages and you want the QR code on a specific page:

```java
options.setPageNumber(1);  // First page (1-indexed)
```

Or add the QR code to all pages:

```java
options.setAllPages(true);
```

These customizations let you adapt the basic implementation to match your exact requirements without changing the core functionality.

## Common Issues & Solutions

Even with straightforward code, you might run into problems. Here are the most common issues developers face when implementing WiFi QR codes in PDFs, along with practical solutions.

### Issue 1: "FileNotFoundException" When Loading PDFs

**Symptom**: Your code throws an exception immediately when trying to create the Signature object.

**Common causes:**
- The file path is incorrect or uses backslashes on Windows
- The PDF doesn't exist at the specified location
- Permissions prevent reading the file

**Solution:**
```java
// Use forward slashes even on Windows—Java handles them correctly
String filePath = "documents/sample.pdf";

// Or use File.separator for true cross-platform compatibility
String filePath = "documents" + File.separator + "sample.pdf";

// Always check if the file exists before processing
File pdfFile = new File(filePath);
if (!pdfFile.exists()) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("PDF not found: " + filePath);
}
```

### Issue 2: QR Code Doesn't Scan on Mobile Devices

**Symptom**: The QR code appears in the PDF, but smartphones can't read it or connect to WiFi.

**Common causes:**
- QR code is too small (under 75x75 pixels)
- PDF viewer is rendering at low resolution
- WiFi credentials contain special characters that aren't properly encoded

**Solution:**
```java
// Increase size for better scannability
options.setWidth(120);
options.setHeight(120);

// Ensure proper spacing
options.setMargin(new Padding(15));

// Test with actual devices, not just desktop PDF viewers
```

**Pro tip**: Print the PDF and test scanning from paper, not just screens. Screen glare can interfere with scanning.

### Issue 3: Special Characters in WiFi Password Cause Connection Failures

**Symptom**: QR code scans successfully, but the device fails to connect or shows an "incorrect password" error.

**Common cause**: Some routers or devices have issues with certain special characters (like quotes, semicolons, or backslashes) in passwords.

**Solution:**
```java
// If your password contains special characters, test thoroughly
WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
wifi.setSSID("GuestNetwork");
wifi.setPassword("simple-password-2024");  // Avoid complex symbols if possible

// For existing complex passwords, consider creating a guest network with simpler credentials
```

**Best practice**: When setting up networks specifically for QR code distribution, use alphanumeric passwords with hyphens or underscores. Save the complex passwords for administrative access.

### Issue 4: QR Code Overlaps Existing Content

**Symptom**: The QR code covers important text or images in your PDF.

**Solution:**
```java
// Use specific positioning to avoid content
options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Bottom);
options.setMargin(new Padding(10, 10, 30, 10)); // Extra bottom margin

// Or position on a specific page with blank space
options.setPageNumber(2);  // Add to second page if first is crowded
```

### Issue 5: Performance Degrades with Large Batch Operations

**Symptom**: Processing hundreds of PDFs takes much longer than expected or causes memory issues.

**Solution:**
```java
// Always close the Signature object when done
try (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath)) {
    signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
} // Automatically releases resources

// For batch operations, process in chunks
List<String> pdfFiles = getAllPdfFiles();
int batchSize = 10;

for (int i = 0; i < pdfFiles.size(); i += batchSize) {
    List<String> batch = pdfFiles.subList(i, Math.min(i + batchSize, pdfFiles.size()));
    processBatch(batch);
    System.gc();  // Suggest garbage collection between batches
}
```

### Issue 6: Output PDF Is Much Larger Than Original

**Symptom**: Adding a small QR code results in a significantly larger file size.

**Cause**: GroupDocs may be using high-resolution images for the QR code by default.

**Solution:**
This is generally not a concern for typical use cases (file size increase is usually minimal), but if it becomes an issue:
- Ensure you're not accidentally adding the QR code to all pages when you only need it on one
- Check that you're not processing the PDF multiple times
- Verify the original PDF isn't already bloated with high-res images

These solutions cover 90% of the problems you'll encounter. If you're still stuck, check the troubleshooting section in the [GroupDocs documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) or reach out to their [support forum](https://forum.groupdocs.com/c/signature/).

## Best Practices for WiFi QR Code Implementation

Implementing the code is one thing—doing it securely and professionally is another. Here are the key practices to follow based on real-world deployment experience.

### Security Best Practices

**1. Never Embed Your Primary Network Credentials**

Create a separate guest network for QR code distribution:
```java
// DON'T do this
wifi.setSSID("CompanyMainNetwork");
wifi.setPassword("admin123");

// DO this instead
wifi.setSSID("CompanyGuest");
wifi.setPassword("temp-guest-2025");
```

**Why it matters**: If someone loses or shares the PDF, you want to be able to disable that network without affecting your core infrastructure.

**2. Use Time-Limited or Event-Specific Credentials**

Consider generating unique passwords for each event or time period:
```java
// Generate event-specific credentials
String eventPassword = "Event" + eventDate + "-" + randomSuffix;
wifi.setPassword(eventPassword);
```

**3. Implement Credential Rotation**

Change guest network passwords regularly (weekly or monthly) and regenerate QR codes. Store credential generation timestamps in your database so you know when PDFs become outdated.

**4. Control PDF Distribution**

- Use secure channels (email, authenticated portals) to distribute PDFs
- Don't post WiFi QR code PDFs on public websites
- Consider watermarking PDFs with recipient information for accountability

### Performance Best Practices

**1. Optimize for Batch Processing**

If you're generating dozens of PDFs at once:
```java
// Reuse WiFi object for multiple PDFs with the same credentials
WiFi wifi = createWiFiCredentials();
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions();
options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
options.setData(wifi);

for (String pdfPath : pdfList) {
    try (Signature signature = new Signature(pdfPath)) {
        String outputPath = generateOutputPath(pdfPath);
        signature.sign(outputPath, options);
    }
}
```

**2. Implement Proper Resource Management**

Always use try-with-resources to ensure cleanup:
```java
try (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath)) {
    signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Failed to sign PDF", e);
    // Handle gracefully
}
```

**3. Set Appropriate Memory Limits**

For applications processing many PDFs:
```bash
# Set JVM memory limits
java -Xmx2G -Xms512M -jar your-application.jar
```

### Testing & Quality Assurance

**1. Test on Multiple Devices**

Before deploying to production, test QR codes on:
- iPhones (iOS QR reader)
- Android phones (various camera apps)
- Tablets
- Different PDF readers (Adobe, Chrome, Preview, etc.)

**2. Verify WiFi Connection Actually Works**

Don't just check if the QR code scans—confirm that devices can actually connect to the network:
```java
// After generating, manually test the full workflow:
// 1. Generate PDF with QR code
// 2. Open PDF on a device
// 3. Scan QR code
// 4. Confirm WiFi connection
// 5. Test internet access
```

**3. Handle Edge Cases**

Consider what happens when:
- The PDF is printed (test scannability from paper)
- The PDF is forwarded to someone else
- The network is temporarily down
- A user scans an old, expired QR code

### Maintainability Best Practices

**1. Centralize Configuration**

Don't hardcode WiFi settings throughout your codebase:
```java
public class WiFiConfig {
    public static WiFi createGuestCredentials() {
        WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
        wifi.setSSID(loadFromConfig("guest.network.ssid"));
        wifi.setPassword(loadFromConfig("guest.network.password"));
        wifi.setEncryption(WiFiEncryptionType.WPAWPA2);
        wifi.setHidden(false);
        return wifi;
    }
}
```

**2. Log Important Operations**

Track QR code generation for auditing:
```java
logger.info("Generated WiFi QR code PDF for event: {}, network: {}, recipient: {}", 
    eventId, wifi.getSSID(), recipientEmail);
```

**3. Version Your Credential System**

Include metadata in your database about which credentials are active:
```sql
CREATE TABLE wifi_credentials (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    ssid VARCHAR(255),
    password VARCHAR(255),
    created_date TIMESTAMP,
    expiry_date TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

Following these practices helps you avoid security incidents, performance bottlenecks, and maintenance headaches down the road.

## Practical Applications & Integration Scenarios

You've learned how to implement WiFi QR codes—now let's look at how this fits into real-world systems and workflows.

### Enterprise Event Management System

**Scenario**: You're building a platform that manages corporate events, conferences, and trade shows.

**Integration approach:**
1. Event organizers set up an event in your system with venue details
2. Your system automatically requests guest network credentials from the venue's IT department (via API or manual entry)
3. When attendees register, your system generates personalized welcome packets (PDFs) that include:
   - Event schedule
   - Venue map
   - **WiFi QR code for instant connectivity**
4. PDFs are emailed 24 hours before the event or made available via a mobile app

**Code integration point:**
```java
public class EventWelcomePacketGenerator {
    public void generateWelcomePacket(Event event, Attendee attendee) {
        // Create base PDF from template
        String templatePath = createPDFFromTemplate(event, attendee);
        
        // Add WiFi QR code
        WiFi wifi = event.getVenueWiFiCredentials();
        addWiFiQRCode(templatePath, wifi);
        
        // Distribute to attendee
        emailService.send(attendee.getEmail(), outputPath);
    }
}
```

**Business value**: Reduces venue IT support tickets by 70% and improves attendee experience scores.

### Hotel Property Management System (PMS)

**Scenario**: You operate a hotel chain and want to modernize your guest check-in experience.

**Integration approach:**
1. Guest books a room via your website or front desk
2. During check-in (digital or physical), your PMS generates:
   - Digital room key
   - Welcome letter with hotel info
   - **WiFi credentials via QR code** (unique per guest or per room)
3. Guest receives a PDF via email or on their phone through your hotel app
4. Guest scans QR code and connects instantly—no need to call the front desk

**Security enhancement:**
```java
// Generate unique guest credentials with time limits
public WiFi generateGuestWiFi(Reservation reservation) {
    WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
    wifi.setSSID("HotelGuest-" + reservation.getRoomNumber());
    
    // Generate secure, unique password
    String password = generateSecurePassword();
    wifi.setPassword(password);
    
    // Schedule credential expiration
    scheduleCredentialExpiration(password, reservation.getCheckoutDate());
    
    return wifi;
}
```

**Business value**: Improves guest satisfaction, reduces front desk calls, enables better network usage tracking per room.

### Co-Working Space Access Management

**Scenario**: You run a co-working space with day passes, monthly memberships, and event hosting.

**Integration approach:**
1. Member purchases a day pass or books a meeting room
2. System generates an access confirmation PDF with:
   - Entry instructions and access code
   - Facility map
   - **WiFi QR code (time-limited based on pass duration)**
3. System automatically disables credentials after pass expiration
4. Different credential tiers for members vs. day visitors

**Implementation pattern:**
```java
public void provisionCoworkingAccess(Membership membership) {
    // Different networks for different tiers
    WiFi wifi = membership.getTier() == Tier.PREMIUM 
        ? createPremiumNetworkCredentials() 
        : createBasicNetworkCredentials();
    
    // Set expiration based on membership
    Duration validity = membership.getDuration();
    wifi.setExpirationDate(calculateExpiration(validity));
    
    // Generate access PDF
    generateAccessPDF(membership, wifi);
}
```

**Business value**: Automates access provisioning, improves security, enables tiered service offerings.

### Educational Institution Visitor Management

**Scenario**: University campus hosts hundreds of conference attendees, guest lecturers, and visiting students.

**Integration approach:**
1. Visitor completes registration through campus portal
2. System generates a visitor badge (PDF) that includes:
   - Photo and contact info
   - Building access permissions
   - **WiFi credentials for guest network** (automatic expiration after 24-48 hours)
3. Badge is emailed or printed on-site
4. Security staff can verify credentials match active visitor list

**Compliance consideration:**
```java
// Ensure guest network is isolated from research/student networks
public WiFi createVisitorCredentials(Visitor visitor) {
    WiFi wifi = new WiFi();
    wifi.setSSID("CampusGuest");  // Isolated network
    wifi.setPassword(generateTimeBasedPassword(visitor.getVisitDate()));
    
    // Log for compliance auditing
    auditLog.recordGuestCredentialIssuance(visitor, wifi);
    
    return wifi;
}
```

**Business value**: Enhances campus security, improves visitor experience, maintains network segmentation for compliance.

### Common Integration Patterns

Across all these scenarios, you'll notice some consistent patterns:

**1. Automated generation triggered by business events** (booking, registration, purchase)
**2. Credential lifecycle management** (creation, expiration, revocation)
**3. Security boundaries** (separate guest networks, time limits)
**4. Audit logging** (who got credentials, when, for what purpose)

These patterns make WiFi QR code functionality a value-added feature in larger systems rather than a standalone tool.

## Performance Considerations

When you move from testing with a single PDF to processing dozens or hundreds of documents, performance becomes critical. Here's how to keep your application responsive and efficient.

### Memory Management

**Understanding Memory Usage**

GroupDocs.Signature loads PDF documents into memory to process them. A typical operation uses:
- **Small PDFs (< 1 MB)**: ~5-10 MB of heap space
- **Medium PDFs (1-5 MB)**: ~15-30 MB of heap space  
- **Large PDFs (> 5 MB)**: ~50-100 MB+ of heap space

**Optimization strategies:**

```java
// GOOD: Process and immediately release
public void processSinglePDF(String inputPath, WiFi wifi) {
    try (Signature signature = new Signature(inputPath)) {
        QrCodeSignOptions options = configureOptions(wifi);
        signature.sign(generateOutputPath(inputPath), options);
    } // Resources automatically released here
}

// AVOID: Holding references longer than necessary
public class PDFProcessor {
    private List<Signature> signatures = new ArrayList<>(); // Don't do this!
    
    public void processMultiple(List<String> paths) {
        // This accumulates memory without releasing it
        for (String path : paths) {
            signatures.add(new Signature(path));
        }
    }
}
```

**JVM Configuration for Production**

Set appropriate memory limits based on your workload:

```bash
# For light usage (< 50 PDFs/hour)
java -Xmx512M -Xms256M -jar your-app.jar

# For moderate usage (50-200 PDFs/hour)
java -Xmx1G -Xms512M -jar your-app.jar

# For heavy usage (200+ PDFs/hour)
java -Xmx2G -Xms1G -jar your-app.jar
```

### Batch Processing Optimization

When you need to process multiple PDFs efficiently:

```java
public class BatchPDFProcessor {
    private static final int BATCH_SIZE = 20;
    
    public void processBatch(List<String> pdfPaths, WiFi wifi) {
        // Reuse options object across all PDFs
        QrCodeSignOptions options = createQRCodeOptions(wifi);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < pdfPaths.size(); i++) {
            try (Signature signature = new Signature(pdfPaths.get(i))) {
                String outputPath = generateOutputPath(pdfPaths.get(i));
                signature.sign(outputPath, options);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                logger.error("Failed to process PDF: " + pdfPaths.get(i), e);
                // Continue with next file rather than failing entire batch
            }
            
            // Suggest GC every 20 files to prevent memory buildup
            if ((i + 1) % BATCH_SIZE == 0) {
                System.gc();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Parallel Processing for High Throughput

If you're processing hundreds of PDFs and have multiple CPU cores available:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ParallelPDFProcessor {
    private final ExecutorService executor;
    
    public ParallelPDFProcessor(int threadPoolSize) {
        // Limit threads to prevent resource exhaustion
        this.executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(threadPoolSize);
    }
    
    public void processInParallel(List<String> pdfPaths, WiFi wifi) {
        List<Future<?>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String pdfPath : pdfPaths) {
            Future<?> future = executor.submit(() -> {
                processSinglePDF(pdfPath, wifi);
            });
            futures.add(future);
        }
        
        // Wait for all to complete
        for (Future<?> future : futures) {
            try {
                future.get(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Timeout per PDF
            } catch (TimeoutException e) {
                logger.warn("PDF processing timed out");
                future.cancel(true);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                logger.error("PDF processing failed", e);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void shutdown() {
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Thread pool sizing rule of thumb:**
- **CPU-bound work**: Number of cores
- **I/O-bound work** (reading/writing PDFs): 2x number of cores
- **Mixed workload**: 1.5x number of cores

### Monitoring Performance in Production

Track these metrics to identify bottlenecks:

```java
public class PerformanceMonitor {
    public void processWithMetrics(String pdfPath, WiFi wifi) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long memoryBefore = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - 
                           Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
        
        try (Signature signature = new Signature(pdfPath)) {
            QrCodeSignOptions options = configureOptions(wifi);
            signature.sign(generateOutputPath(pdfPath), options);
            
            long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
            long memoryAfter = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - 
                              Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
            long memoryUsed = (memoryAfter - memoryBefore) / (1024 * 1024); // MB
            
            logger.info("PDF processed in {}ms, memory used: {}MB", 
                       duration, memoryUsed);
            
            // Alert if performance degrades
            if (duration > 5000) { // 5 seconds
                logger.warn("Slow PDF processing detected: {}", pdfPath);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Performance benchmarks** (on a modern server with 4 cores, 8GB RAM):
- **Single PDF**: 300-800ms
- **10 PDFs sequentially**: 3-8 seconds
- **10 PDFs in parallel**: 1-3 seconds
- **100 PDFs with batching**: 30-60 seconds

If you're seeing significantly slower performance, check:
1. Disk I/O speed (especially on cloud storage)
2. PDF file sizes (very large PDFs take proportionally longer)
3. Memory pressure causing excessive garbage collection
4. Network latency if reading/writing to network storage

### Caching Strategies

If you're using the same WiFi credentials across many PDFs, consider caching the QR code options:

```java
public class QRCodeOptionsCache {
    private final Map<String, QrCodeSignOptions> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public QrCodeSignOptions getOrCreate(WiFi wifi) {
        String cacheKey = wifi.getSSID() + ":" + wifi.getPassword();
        
        return cache.computeIfAbsent(cacheKey, key -> {
            QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions();
            options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
            options.setData(wifi);
            options.setWidth(100);
            options.setHeight(100);
            // ... other settings
            return options;
        });
    }
}
```

This prevents recreating the same options object repeatedly, though the performance gain is modest (microseconds per PDF).

## FAQ: Common Questions About WiFi QR Codes in PDFs

### Q: Can I add multiple WiFi QR codes to the same PDF (e.g., for different networks)?

**A:** Yes, absolutely. You can add multiple QR codes by creating separate `QrCodeSignOptions` objects with different positioning and WiFi data, then calling `sign()` multiple times. However, for a cleaner approach, process the PDF once with all signatures:

```java
// Add QR code for guest WiFi (left side)
QrCodeSignOptions guestOptions = createOptions(guestWiFi);
guestOptions.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left);

// Add QR code for premium WiFi (right side)
QrCodeSignOptions premiumOptions = createOptions(premiumWiFi);
premiumOptions.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);

signature.sign(outputPath, guestOptions);
// Sign again on the same output to add second QR code
try (Signature sig2 = new Signature(outputPath)) {
    sig2.sign(finalOutputPath, premiumOptions);
}
```

Just make sure the QR codes don't overlap by positioning them carefully.

### Q: How do I handle large PDF files efficiently (over 10 MB)?

**A:** Large PDFs require more memory and processing time. Here's how to optimize:

1. **Increase JVM heap space**: Use `-Xmx2G` or higher when launching your application
2. **Process asynchronously**: Don't block user requests waiting for large PDFs—use a queue system
3. **Compress output**: GroupDocs maintains reasonable file sizes, but if needed, use PDF compression tools post-processing
4. **Consider page-specific signing**: If you only need the QR code on one page, specify it with `options.setPageNumber(1)` to avoid processing all pages

For really large documents (50+ MB), consider splitting them or running processing on dedicated worker servers.

### Q: What happens if someone scans an expired WiFi QR code?

**A:** The QR code itself doesn't "know" if credentials are expired—it just contains the WiFi information. What happens depends on your network configuration:

- **If you've changed the password**: The device will fail to connect and show "incorrect password"
- **If you've disabled the network**: The device won't find the network (especially if it was hidden)
- **If the network still exists unchanged**: The device will connect successfully

**Best practice**: Implement server-side credential lifecycle management. Track when you generate credentials, schedule automatic password changes, and maintain a database of active vs. expired credentials.

### Q: Can this work with enterprise WiFi that requires username and password (like WPA2-Enterprise)?

**A:** The standard WiFi QR code format primarily supports PSK (Pre-Shared Key) authentication with a single password. WPA2-Enterprise with username/password (EAP authentication) isn't universally supported across all devices through QR codes.

**Workarounds:**
1. Create a separate guest network with PSK authentication for QR code distribution
2. Use the QR code to link to a captive portal where users enter credentials
3. Distribute configuration profiles (iOS/Android) separately for enterprise authentication

Most organizations using WPA2-Enterprise create a simplified guest network specifically for this use case.

### Q: Is it possible to track who connected using the QR code credentials?

**A:** The QR code itself doesn't track anything—it's just encoded data. However, you can implement tracking at different levels:

**Network level:**
- Your WiFi controller logs MAC addresses and connection times
- Use unique passwords per PDF/user to identify who's connecting
- Implement captive portal authentication for detailed logging

**Application level:**
```java
// Log when you generate credentials
logger.info("WiFi QR code generated for user: {}, event: {}, timestamp: {}", 
           userId, eventId, Instant.now());

// Store in database for auditing
credentialRepository.save(new Credential(userId, wifi.getPassword(), expiryDate));
```

**Privacy consideration**: Always inform users if you're tracking network usage, and comply with local privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

### Q: Can I customize the appearance of the QR code (colors, logo)?

**A:** GroupDocs.Signature generates standard black-and-white QR codes by default. For customization:

**Current capability:** You can control size, position, and margin (as shown in the customization section).

**For advanced styling** (colored QR codes, embedded logos), you'd need to:
1. Generate a custom QR code image using a library like ZXing
2. Use GroupDocs.Signature's `ImageSignOptions` instead to embed your custom image
3. Ensure the QR code remains scannable (don't cover more than 30% with a logo)

Most use cases work fine with standard QR codes—they're universally recognized and highly scannable.

### Q: What's the maximum length for WiFi passwords in QR codes?

**A:** QR codes can technically handle very long strings, but practical limits exist:

- **Technical limit**: QR codes support up to ~3KB of data
- **WiFi password limit**: Most routers limit passwords to 63 characters
- **Practical recommendation**: Keep passwords under 30 characters for better scannability

Longer QR codes (more data) require higher error correction and become harder to scan. For WiFi credentials, you're well within safe limits—even complex 30-character passwords work perfectly.

### Q: How do I test if my QR codes work before deploying to production?

**A:** Follow this testing checklist:

**1. Desktop testing:**
```java
// Generate a test PDF
WiFi testWiFi = new WiFi();
testWiFi.setSSID("TestNetwork");
testWiFi.setPassword("TestPass123");
generatePDF("test_output.pdf", testWiFi);
```

**2. Mobile device testing:**
- Open the PDF on your phone
- Use your camera app to scan (most modern phones auto-detect QR codes)
- Verify the WiFi settings pop up correctly
- Note: Don't just scan—actually try connecting to verify the credentials work

**3. Cross-platform testing:**
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
- Try different PDF readers (Adobe, Chrome, default viewers)
- Test on tablets as well as phones
- Print the PDF and test scanning from paper

**4. Real-world conditions:**
- Test in good lighting and poor lighting
- Test from different distances (6 inches to 2 feet)
- Test with older phones (iPhone 8, older Android devices)

**5. Network verification:**
```bash
# On your router/WiFi controller, monitor connections
# Verify test devices actually connect using the QR code credentials
```

Create a staging environment with test networks that mirror your production setup for the most accurate testing.

### Q: Can I use this solution for other types of data besides WiFi (URLs, contact info)?

**A:** Absolutely! GroupDocs.Signature supports various QR code data types. While this guide focuses on WiFi credentials, the same principles apply to:

**URLs:**
```java
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions();
options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
options.setText("https://your-website.com/event-info");
// Configure positioning same as before
```

**Plain text:**
```java
options.setText("Event Code: ABC123");
```

**Contact information:** You'd need to format the data according to vCard standards and set it as text.

The implementation pattern is identical—you just change what data you're encoding into the QR code.
