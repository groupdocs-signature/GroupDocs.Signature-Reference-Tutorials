This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Signature to sign Excel spreadsheets with QR codes and save them in different formats.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to sign spreadsheets using QR code signatures.
- Save signed documents in multiple output formats like PDF, XLSX, etc.
- Optimize your Java application's performance when dealing with document signatures.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of integrating and utilizing GroupDocs.Signature for signing tasks in your Java applications. Let's dive into setting up the necessary tools before we start implementing these features!

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and familiarity with Maven or Gradle build systems.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

Additionally, you'll need to set up GroupDocs.Signature for Java in your project. The setup process is straightforward and can be achieved using Maven or Gradle dependencies as shown below:

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To begin with, add the GroupDocs.Signature dependency to your project's build file.

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Alternatively, you can download the library directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

#### License Acquisition
To fully utilize GroupDocs.Signature's features:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full access during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: For long-term usage, consider purchasing a commercial license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Initialize the `Signature` class by passing your document file path as shown below:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

// Initialize with your document's path
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SampleSpreadsheet.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll walk through the steps to sign a spreadsheet and save it using GroupDocs.Signature.

### Signing a Spreadsheet with QR Code
#### Overview
This feature allows you to add QR code signatures to your Excel spreadsheets. It's particularly useful for adding secure electronic identifiers that can be easily scanned.
##### Step 1: Define File Paths
Start by defining the paths for both input and output files:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SampleSpreadsheet.xlsx";
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signedDocument.pdf";
```
##### Step 2: Initialize Signature Object
Create a `Signature` object with your document's file path.
```java
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```
##### Step 3: Create QR Code Sign Options
Configure the QR code signing options. Specify properties like text, type, and position of the QR code:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.QrCodeSignOptions;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.qrcodes.QrCodeTypes;

QrCodeSignOptions signOptions = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith");
signOptions.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
signOptions.setLeft(100); // X-coordinate
signOptions.setTop(100);  // Y-coordinate
```
##### Step 4: Configure Save Options
Specify how you want the signed document to be saved, including its format:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.saveoptions.SpreadsheetSaveOptions;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.SpreadsheetSaveFileFormat;

SpreadsheetSaveOptions saveOptions = new SpreadsheetSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setFileFormat(SpreadsheetSaveFileFormat.Pdf);
saveOptions.setOverwriteExistingFiles(true);
```
##### Step 5: Sign and Save the Document
Finally, use the `sign` method to apply your QR code signature and save the document:
```java
try {
    signature.sign(outputFilePath, signOptions, saveOptions);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
### Saving a Document in Different Output File Formats
#### Overview
GroupDocs.Signature allows you to save signed documents into various formats such as PDF, XLSX, and DOCX.
##### Step 1: Define the Output Path
Specify your desired output file path and format:
```java
String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/signedDocument.pdf"; // Change format as needed
```
##### Step 2: Set Up Save Options
Configure `SpreadsheetSaveOptions` to define how you want the document saved:
```java
SpreadsheetSaveOptions saveOptions = new SpreadsheetSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setFileFormat(SpreadsheetSaveFileFormat.Pdf); // Can be altered for different formats
saveOptions.setOverwriteExistingFiles(true);
```
##### Step 3: Implement Signing Operation
Use these options in a signing operation. Ensure the `signature` object is properly initialized:
```java
// Example usage (assuming signature object exists)
signature.sign(outputPath, signOptions, saveOptions);
```
## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where this functionality can be beneficial:
- **Legal Documents**: Securely sign contracts with QR codes for easy verification.
- **Financial Reports**: Add signatures to spreadsheets containing sensitive financial data.
- **Inventory Management**: Use QR codes on inventory sheets for streamlined tracking and authentication.

## Performance Considerations
When working with document signing, consider the following tips:
- Optimize your Java memory management by profiling resource usage during signature operations.
- GroupDocs.Signature is optimized for performance, but ensure you're running it in a suitable environment to handle large documents efficiently.

## Conclusion
By now, you should be comfortable using GroupDocs.Signature to sign and save Excel spreadsheets with QR codes. This powerful tool can greatly enhance the security and authenticity of your digital documents. As next steps, explore additional features like text signatures or stamp signatures to further secure your documents.
