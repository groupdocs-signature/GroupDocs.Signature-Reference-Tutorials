Integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your project using Maven, Gradle, or by direct download. Here's how:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download:**
Visit [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) to download the latest version.

### License Acquisition

Start with a free trial or obtain a temporary license to explore GroupDocs.Signature's full capabilities. For long-term use, consider purchasing a license from [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To begin using GroupDocs.Signature, initialize the library in your Java application:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

public class InitializeSignature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Signature signature = new Signature("your-document-path");
        System.out.println("GroupDocs.Signature initialized successfully.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Download Document from Azure Blob Storage

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates downloading a document stored in Azure Blob storage, which is essential for accessing documents you wish to sign.

##### Step 1: Set Up Azure Credentials
Start by configuring your Azure storage connection string:

```java
public class AzureBlobSetup {
    public static final String STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;" +
            "AccountName=Ram;" + 
            "AccountKey=key;";
}
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve Blob Container
Use the following method to get a reference to your blob container:

```java
private static CloudBlobContainer getContainer() throws Exception {
    String containerName = "***"; // Specify your container name here
    CloudStorageAccount cloudStorageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING);
    CloudBlobClient cloudBlobClient = cloudStorageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();
    CloudBlobContainer container = cloudBlobClient.getContainerReference(containerName);
    container.createIfNotExists();
    return container;
}
```

##### Step 3: Download the Blob
Implement the download functionality to retrieve your document as a `ByteArrayOutputStream`:

```java
public static ByteArrayOutputStream downloadFile(String blobName) throws Exception {
    CloudBlobContainer container = getContainer();
    CloudBlob blob = container.getBlockBlobReference(blobName);
    ByteArrayOutputStream memoryStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    blob.download(memoryStream);
    return memoryStream;
}
```

### Feature 2: Sign Document with QR Code

#### Overview
Signing a document with a QR code adds an extra layer of security and authenticity. This feature demonstrates how to sign documents using GroupDocs.Signature.

##### Step 1: Initialize Signature Object
Create a `Signature` object from your input file:

```java
public static void signDocument(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath) throws GroupDocsSignatureException {
    try (ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(inputFilePath.getBytes())) {
        Signature signature = new Signature(inputStream);
```

##### Step 2: Configure QR Code Options
Set up the QR code options for signing:

```java
QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions("JohnSmith");
options.setEncodeType(QrCodeTypes.QR);
options.setLeft(100); 
options.setTop(100);  
```

##### Step 3: Sign and Save Document
Execute the signing process and save the signed document:

```java
signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
    }
}
```

## Practical Applications
- **Legal Documents**: Secure contracts with QR code signatures for easy verification.
- **Financial Reports**: Enhance authenticity of financial documents shared digitally.
- **Educational Certificates**: Digitally sign certificates to prevent forgery.

Integrating GroupDocs.Signature can streamline document management processes across various industries, enhancing security and efficiency.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- Manage Java memory efficiently by properly handling streams and resources.
- Use asynchronous processing where possible to enhance application responsiveness.
- Regularly update your library version for improved features and bug fixes.

## Conclusion
You've now learned how to download documents from Azure Blob Storage and sign them with QR codes using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. This powerful combination enhances document security and authenticity, crucial in today's digital landscape.
