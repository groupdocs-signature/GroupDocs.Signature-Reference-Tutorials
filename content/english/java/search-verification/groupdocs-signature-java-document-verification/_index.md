- **Environment Setup**: A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and JDK 1.8 or higher installed on your machine.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with Maven or Gradle build systems will be helpful.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java
#### Installation
To start using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, add it as a dependency in your project. Hereâ€™s how:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download**
You can download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

#### License Acquisition
To use GroupDocs.Signature, you have several options:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a trial to explore its features.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license if you need more than the free version offers.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for long-term usage.

After acquiring your license, initialize it in your application as per the documentation instructions.

### Implementation Guide
#### Document Verification with Barcode Signatures
**Overview**
This feature allows you to verify documents using barcode signatures, ensuring they have not been tampered with and are authentic.

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
Start by creating a `Signature` object pointing to your document:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.VerificationResult;
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.verify.BarcodeVerifyOptions;

String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**Step 2: Configure Verification Options**
Configure `BarcodeVerifyOptions` to specify how the verification should be conducted:
```java
// Initialize BarcodeVerifyOptions with specific settings.
BarcodeVerifyOptions options = new BarcodeVerifyOptions();

// Set verification criteria for all pages of the document.
options.setAllPages(true); // Checks all pages by default.

// Specify expected text within the barcode signature.
options.setText("12345");

// Define how the barcode text should match against the expected value.
options.setMatchType(TextMatchType.Contains);
```

**Step 3: Perform Verification**
Execute the verification process and handle the results:
```java
try {
    // Perform verification of document signatures based on defined criteria.
    VerificationResult result = signature.verify(options);

    // Check if the document is verified successfully.
    if (result.isValid()) {
        System.out.println("Document was verified successfully!");
        for (BaseSignature temp : result.getSucceeded()) {
            System.out.printf(" - #%d-%s at: %dx%d. Size: %dx%d%n\
