# Mastering QR Code Searches in Java: A Complete Guide Using GroupDocs.Signature

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, integrating QR codes into documents has become a seamless method for storing and retrieving valuable data quickly. However, extracting specific information like Electronic Product Codes (EPC) from these QR codes can be challenging without the right tools. Enter **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**, an efficient solution designed to simplify this process. This tutorial will walk you through using GroupDocs.Signature to search for and extract EPC data from QR codes embedded in documents, enhancing your Java applications' capability.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and configure GroupDocs.Signature for Java.
- Implementing a feature to search for QR-code signatures containing EPC data.
- Extracting and utilizing EPC information effectively within your application.
- Optimizing performance when handling large documents with multiple QR codes.

Let's dive into the prerequisites required before we begin coding!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**: Version 23.12 or later. This library is essential for accessing the functionalities needed to search and extract QR code data.

### Environment Setup
- A working Java development environment (JDK 8+ recommended).
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode with Maven/Gradle support.
  

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with handling dependencies in a build tool (Maven or Gradle).

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To begin using GroupDocs.Signature for Java, you must first install the library. Here's how to do it using different methods:

**Maven Installation**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle Installation**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download**
If you prefer, download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition

To fully leverage GroupDocs.Signature's capabilities, consider obtaining a license:
- **Free Trial**: Test features without restrictions.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain access to all functionalities for evaluation purposes. Learn more at [GroupDocs Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license).
- **Purchase**: For long-term use and support, purchase a license from [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

**Basic Initialization**
Once installed, initialize the library in your project:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
// Define path to your document directory
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have set up GroupDocs.Signature for Java, let's implement the QR code search and EPC data extraction feature.

### Search for QR-Code Signatures

The first step is to search for QR-code signatures within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates this process:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.SignatureType;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.signatures.QrCodeSignature;
List<QrCodeSignature> signatures = signature.search(QrCodeSignature.class, SignatureType.QrCode);
```

**Explanation**: 
- `search`: This method scans the document for QR-code signatures.
- `QrCodeSignature.class`: Specifies that we are looking for QR-code type signatures.
- `SignatureType.QrCode`: Indicates the signature type to search.

### Extract EPC Data from QR Codes

Once you've identified the QR codes, extract the EPC data using:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions.serialization.EPC;
for (QrCodeSignature qrSignature : signatures) {
    EPC payment = qrSignature.getData(EPC.class);
    if (payment != null) {
        System.out.println("Found EPC payment signature. Name " + payment.getName() + \
