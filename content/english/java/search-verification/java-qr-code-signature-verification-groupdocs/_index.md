## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To use GroupDocs.Signature, integrate it into your project as follows:

### Maven Integration
Add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```
### Gradle Integration
Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```
### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Acquire a full license for production use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Signature, create an instance of the `Signature` class with your document's path:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```
## Implementation Guide

Explore how to verify documents using QR code signatures in Java.

### Verify Document with QR-Code Signature

#### Overview
This feature allows you to verify a document containing a QR Code signature by leveraging the GroupDocs.Signature library, ensuring no alterations post-signing.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Create and Configure Verification Options**
Start by setting up your `QrCodeVerifyOptions`:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.verify.QrCodeVerifyOptions;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.enums.TextMatchType;

// Initialize QR code verification options
QrCodeVerifyOptions options = new QrCodeVerifyOptions();
options.setAllPages(true);  // Verify all pages.
options.setText("John");    // Text to be found in the QR Code.
options.setMatchType(TextMatchType.Contains);  // Match type: Contains.
```
**2. Perform Verification**
With your `Signature` instance and `QrCodeVerifyOptions` set up, proceed with verification:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.VerificationResult;

try {
    // Verify the document signatures
    VerificationResult result = signature.verify(options);
    
    // Check if the verification was successful
    boolean isValid = result.isValid();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Handle any exceptions that may arise during verification
}
```
**Explanation of Parameters:**
- `setAllPages(true)`: Ensures all pages in the document are verified, crucial for comprehensive validation.
- `setText("John")`: Defines the expected text within the QR code signature. Customize this to match your requirements.
- `setMatchType(TextMatchType.Contains)`: Specifies that verification should check if the specified text is contained within the QR code.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Invalid Signature**: Ensure the text in the QR code matches exactly what you specify, considering case sensitivity and spaces.
- **Document Path Issues**: Verify that your document path is correct and accessible from your application's environment.

### Set QR Code Verify Options with Text Match Type

#### Overview
This feature helps fine-tune how you verify a QR Code signature by specifying text match types within the `QrCodeVerifyOptions`.

#### Configuration Example
```java
// Create and configure verification options for the QR code.
QrCodeVerifyOptions options = new QrCodeVerifyOptions();
options.setAllPages(true);  // Default behavior: Verify on all pages.
options.setText("John");    // Specify the text to search within the QR Code.
options.setMatchType(TextMatchType.Contains);  // Use Contains match type for verification.
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Legal Document Verification**: Ensure contracts and agreements are verified using QR code signatures before processing.
2. **Educational Certifications**: Validate certificates with embedded QR codes to prevent fraud in academic institutions.
3. **Healthcare Records**: Secure patient records by verifying QR code signatures on medical documents.
4. **Supply Chain Management**: Authenticate shipping documents to ensure the integrity of goods during transit.
5. **Financial Transactions**: Verify transaction receipts that include QR code signatures for added security.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimizing Performance**: Use selective page verification when full document validation is unnecessary.
- **Resource Usage Guidelines**: Manage memory by processing documents in batches if dealing with large volumes.
- **Java Memory Management Best Practices**: Utilize Java's garbage collection effectively to prevent memory leaks during extensive verifications.

## Conclusion

You now have a robust understanding of how to verify documents containing QR code signatures using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. By following the steps outlined, you can enhance document security and streamline your verification processes. Explore further by integrating this feature into larger systems or applications.

### Next Steps
- Experiment with different `TextMatchType` configurations.
- Integrate document verification into existing workflows.
- Share feedback or ask questions in GroupDocs forums for community support.
