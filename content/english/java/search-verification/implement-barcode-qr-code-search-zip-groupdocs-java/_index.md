# Implement Barcode & QR Code Search in ZIP Archives with GroupDocs for Java
## Introduction
In today's digital world, efficiently managing and verifying document authenticity is crucial. Whether you're dealing with legal documents, invoices, or contracts stored in ZIP archives, finding specific barcodes and QR codes can be challenging without the right tools. This tutorial guides you through using GroupDocs.Signature for Java to seamlessly search for barcode and QR code signatures within ZIP files.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up your environment with GroupDocs.Signature for Java.
- Implementing barcode signature searches in ZIP archives.
- Performing QR code signature searches within the same format.
- Best practices and performance optimization tips.

By following this guide, you'll automate the search process, saving time and reducing errors. Letâ€™s dive into how you can achieve this with GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure your development environment is ready:
1. **Required Libraries:**
   - GroupDocs.Signature for Java (version 23.12 or later).
2. **Environment Setup Requirements:**
   - A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
   - An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of Java programming and file handling.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java
To start using GroupDocs.Signature, include it in your project via a build tool like Maven or Gradle, or by directly downloading the library:

**Maven Setup:**
Add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle Setup:**
Include in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download:**
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition
To get started with GroupDocs.Signature:
- **Free Trial:** Sign up on their website to explore features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license if needed for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing if your needs exceed the trial limits.

Initialize and set up your environment as follows:
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_ZIP");
```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature 1: Search for Barcodes in ZIP Archive
**Overview:**
This feature demonstrates how to search for barcode signatures (specifically Code128 type) within a ZIP archive using GroupDocs.Signature.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Set Barcode Search Options
First, define your barcode search criteria using `BarcodeSearchOptions`:
```java
BarcodeSearchOptions bcOptions = new BarcodeSearchOptions(com.groupdocs.signature.domain.barcodes.BarcodeTypes.Code128);
List<SearchOptions> listOptions = new ArrayList<>();
listOptions.add(bcOptions);
```
##### Perform the Search
Next, execute the search within the ZIP archive:
```java
try {
    SearchResult searchResult = signature.search(listOptions);
    
    // Process results
    int number = 1;
    for (BaseSignature o : searchResult.getSucceeded()) {
        DocumentResultSignature document = (DocumentResultSignature) o;
        System.out.println("Document #" + number++ + ": " + document.getFileName() + ". Processed: " + document.getProcessingTime() + ", mls");
    }
} finally {
    if (signature != null) signature.dispose();
}
```
**Explanation:**  
The `search` method processes the archive and returns a `SearchResult`. We iterate over successfully processed documents to display their details.

### Feature 2: Search for QR Codes in ZIP Archive
**Overview:**
Here, we'll search for QR code signatures within a ZIP archive.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Set QR Code Search Options
Define your QR code search criteria using `QrCodeSearchOptions`:
```java
QrCodeSearchOptions qrOptions = new QrCodeSearchOptions(com.groupdocs.signature.domain.qrcodes.QrCodeTypes.QR);
List<SearchOptions> listOptions = new ArrayList<>();
listOptions.add(qrOptions);
```
##### Perform the Search
Execute the search for QR codes as follows:
```java
try {
    SearchResult searchResult = signature.search(listOptions);
    
    // Process results
    int number = 1;
    for (BaseSignature o : searchResult.getSucceeded()) {
        DocumentResultSignature document = (DocumentResultSignature) o;
        System.out.println("Document #" + number++ + ": " + document.getFileName() + ". Processed: " + document.getProcessingTime() + ", mls");
    }
} finally {
    if (signature != null) signature.dispose();
}
```
**Explanation:**  
Similar to barcode search, the `search` method is used here for QR codes. It retrieves and processes matched signatures.

## Practical Applications
- **Contract Management:** Automate verification of contract authenticity by searching embedded barcodes or QR codes.
- **Inventory Control:** Track items stored in ZIP archives using unique barcode identifiers.
- **Legal Documentation:** Quickly validate legal documents with embedded digital signatures through QR code searches.
- **Secure Document Distribution:** Ensure that distributed documents are authentic and unaltered by checking for specific barcode/QR codes.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Signature:
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple archives in parallel to leverage multi-threading capabilities.
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of `Signature` objects promptly to free up resources.
- **Efficient Search Options:** Narrow down search criteria (e.g., specific barcode types) to reduce processing time.

## Conclusion
We've covered the essentials for implementing barcode and QR code searches within ZIP archives using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. With this knowledge, you can enhance document management processes in your applications by automating signature verification tasks efficiently.

**Next Steps:**
