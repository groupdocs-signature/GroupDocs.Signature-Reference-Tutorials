# Java Stamp Signature Tutorial: Signing PDF Documents with GroupDocs.Signature API

In today's digital landscape, efficient and secure document signing is vital for both businesses and individuals. Whether you're authorizing contracts or verifying documents, ensuring authenticity digitally can save time and resources. This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through using the GroupDocs.Signature for Java API to sign a PDF document with a custom stamp signature. By following this step-by-step process, you'll learn how to add outer and inner lines with specific text, font styles, colors, and positioning.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature for Java
- Creating and customizing stamp signatures
- Implementing code snippets in your Java application
- Practical applications of digital signing

## Prerequisites

Before starting the implementation, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
- **GroupDocs.Signature for Java Library:** Include it as a dependency using Maven or Gradle in your project.
- **Basic Understanding of Java Programming:** Familiarity with file handling and exception management is beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To start, integrate the GroupDocs.Signature library into your Java project by adding it as a dependency:

**Maven:"
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Signature, obtain a license by purchasing or applying for a free trial/temporary license. Visit [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) to explore your options.

### Basic Initialization

After integrating the library into your project, initialize it in your Java application:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

Signature signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf");
```

This line initializes a `Signature` object with the path to your document.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s walk through creating and applying a stamp signature to a PDF file using GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

### Setting Up Stamp Sign Options

Start by setting up the basic parameters for the stamp:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.options.sign.StampSignOptions;
import java.awt.Color;

StampSignOptions options = new StampSignOptions();
options.setLeft(100);  // X-coordinate position
options.setTop(100);   // Y-coordinate position
```

This configuration positions your stamp on the PDF page.

### Configuring the Outer Lines

Create and configure the outer lines of the stamp:

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.stamps.StampLine;

StampLine outerLine = new StampLine();
outerLine.setText(" * European Union *");
outerLine.setFontSize(12);
outerLine.setHeight(22);
outerLine.setTextBottomIntent(6);
outerLine.setTextColor(Color.WHITE);
outerLine.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);

options.getOuterLines().add(outerLine);
```

The `StampLine` class allows you to set various properties, such as text content, font size, color, and positioning.

### Adding Inner Lines

Now add the inner lines of your stamp signature:

```java
StampLine innerLine = new StampLine();
innerLine.setText("John");
innerLine.setTextColor(Color.RED);
innerLine.setFontSize(20);
innerLine.setBold(true);
innerLine.setHeight(40);

options.getInnerLines().add(innerLine);
```

This section sets up the text and style for lines inside your stamp.

### Signing the Document

Finally, sign the document using the configured options:

```java
try {
    signature.sign("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SignWithStamp/sample_signed.pdf", options);
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new Exception(e.getMessage());
}
```

This step applies all configurations to produce a signed PDF file.

## Practical Applications

Digital stamp signing is useful in various scenarios, such as:
- **Contract Approval:** Quickly sign and distribute contracts with visible authenticity.
- **Invoice Processing:** Ensure invoices are securely processed and verified.
- **Document Authorization:** Easily authorize documents without physical presence.
- **Integration with Workflow Systems:** Streamline document approval processes within your existing systems.

## Performance Considerations

When working with digital signatures, consider the following for optimal performance:
- **Memory Management:** Monitor memory usage to prevent leaks during large batch processing.
- **File Size Limitations:** Optimize file sizes to ensure quick signing operations.
- **Optimizing Code Execution:** Profile and refactor your code to enhance execution speed.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement Java PDF signing with stamp signatures using GroupDocs.Signature. This capability can significantly streamline document management workflows by providing an efficient and secure method for digital signing.
