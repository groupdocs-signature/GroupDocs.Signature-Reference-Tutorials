### Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into specific features:

#### Text Signature with Appearance Options
This feature allows you to sign PDF documents using text signatures while customizing their appearance, such as borders and fonts.

##### Overview
You'll learn how to apply various appearance settings like border color, dash style, and font customization to your text signature.

##### Setting Up the Signature
Start by creating a `Signature` object with the file path of your PDF document:
```java
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

##### Configuring Text Sign Options
Define the options for your text signature using `TextSignOptions`. This includes setting the position, size, and appearance details.
```java
TextSignOptions options = new TextSignOptions("John Smith");
options.setLeft(100); // X-coordinate
options.setTop(100);  // Y-coordinate
options.setWidth(100);
options.setHeight(30);
```

##### Customizing Appearance
Use `PdfTextAnnotationAppearance` to set border and font properties:
```java
PdfTextAnnotationAppearance appearance = new PdfTextAnnotationAppearance();

// Configure the border
Border border = new Border();
border.setColor(Color.BLUE);  // Set border color
border.setDashStyle(DashStyle.Dash);  // Dash style
border.setWeight(2);  // Thickness

appearance.setBorder(border);
```

##### Aligning and Margins
Set alignment properties and margins to position the signature precisely:
```java
options.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Bottom);
options.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);

Padding padding = new Padding();
padding.setBottom(20);
padding.setRight(20);
options.setMargin(padding);
```

##### Applying Font Settings
Define font settings for your text signature:
```java
SignatureFont signatureFont = new SignatureFont();
signatureFont.setSize(12);  // Font size
signatureFont.setFamilyName("Comic Sans MS");  // Font family

options.setFont(signatureFont);
```

##### Signing the Document
Finally, sign the document and save it to a specified output path:
```java
signature.sign(outputFilePath, options);
```

#### Border Configuration for Text Signature
This feature focuses on customizing the border properties of your text signature.

##### Overview
Learn how to configure border color, dash style, and effects to enhance the visual appeal of your signatures.

##### Configuring Borders
Create a `Border` object and set its properties:
```java
Border border = new Border();
border.setColor(Color.BLUE);
border.setDashStyle(DashStyle.Dash);
border.setWeight(2);

PdfTextAnnotationBorderEffect borderEffect = PdfTextAnnotationBorderEffect.Cloudy;
int effectIntensity = 2;

appearance.setBorder(border);
appearance.setBorderEffect(borderEffect);
appearance.setBorderEffectIntensity(effectIntensity);
```

#### Font Configuration for Text Signature
Customize the font settings to make your text signature stand out.

##### Overview
Set font size, family, and color to match your branding or document style.

##### Setting Font Properties
Initialize a `SignatureFont` object:
```java
SignatureFont signatureFont = new SignatureFont();
signatureFont.setSize(12);
signatureFont.setFamilyName("Comic Sans MS");

Color textColor = Color.RED;
options.setForeColor(textColor);
```
