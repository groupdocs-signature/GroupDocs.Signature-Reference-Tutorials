## Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, document signing is a critical process that needs to be both secure and efficient. Traditional methods can be cumbersome and time-consuming. With **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**, you can automate the signing of documents using plain or rich text fields, significantly enhancing productivity and accuracy.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to sign documents with plain text fields
- Implementing rich text field signatures in your Java applications
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature for Java in various build systems
- Practical use cases and performance optimization tips

Let's dive into the prerequisites before getting started.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing document signing with **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of JDK.
- **Maven or Gradle**: For managing dependencies easily.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Basic understanding of Java programming.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with document management systems and digital signatures.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To begin using **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**, you need to set up the library in your project. Here are the steps:

**Maven Dependency:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle Implementation:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download:** You can also [download the latest version](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) directly from GroupDocs.

- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended use without limitations.
- **Purchase**: Buy a subscription if you decide to integrate it into your production environment.

**Basic Initialization:**
```java
Signature signature = new Signature("filePath");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Signing with Plain Text Field

This feature allows you to sign documents using simple text inputs. It updates an existing form field within the document.

#### Overview
You can use this method for straightforward signatures where additional formatting isn't necessary.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Initialize Signature Object:**
   Create a `Signature` instance pointing to your document's file path.
   ```java
   String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YOUR_FILE.pdf";
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```

2. **Configure Text Sign Options:**
   Set up the `TextSignOptions` for plain text signing.
   ```java
   TextSignOptions ffOptions1 = new TextSignOptions("Document is approved");
   ffOptions1.setSignatureImplementation(TextSignatureImplementation.FormField);
   ffOptions1.setFormTextFieldType(FormTextFieldType.PlainText);
   ```

3. **Sign the Document:**
   Add your options to a list and execute the signing process.
   ```java
   List<SignOptions> signOptions = new ArrayList<>();
   signOptions.add(ffOptions1);

   String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + fileName;
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, signOptions);
   ```

### Signing with Rich Text Field

Rich text fields offer more flexibility by allowing formatting and metadata inclusion.

#### Overview
Ideal for signatures requiring additional styling or information, such as names and titles.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Initialize Signature Object:**
   Similar to plain text signing, start by creating a `Signature` instance.
   ```java
   String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YOUR_FILE.pdf";
   Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
   ```

2. **Configure Rich Text Sign Options:**
   Set up the `TextSignOptions` for rich text signing.
   ```java
   TextSignOptions ffOptions2 = new TextSignOptions("John Smith");
   ffOptions2.setSignatureImplementation(TextSignatureImplementation.FormField);
   ffOptions2.setFormTextFieldType(FormTextFieldType.RichText);
   ffOptions2.setFormTextFieldTitle("UserSignatureFullName");
   ```

3. **Execute Signing:**
   Compile your options and sign the document.
   ```java
   List<SignOptions> richTextSignOptions = new ArrayList<>();
   richTextSignOptions.add(ffOptions2);

   String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + fileName;
   signature.sign(outputFilePath, richTextSignOptions);
   ```

## Practical Applications

1. **Contract Management**: Automate the approval process for contracts by embedding electronic signatures.
2. **Educational Certifications**: Streamline the issuance of certificates with customizable text fields.
3. **Legal Documents**: Simplify signing legal documents by allowing specific formatting and metadata inclusion.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Limit memory consumption by managing document sizes and processing in batches if necessary.
- **Java Memory Management**: Use efficient data structures and handle exceptions to prevent leaks.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update dependencies and test your implementation for performance bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to implement plain and rich text field signing using **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**. You now have the tools to automate document signing processes in your applications. 

### Next Steps
