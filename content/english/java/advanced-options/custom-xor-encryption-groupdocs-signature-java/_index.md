    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download**
Download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps

1. **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs.Signature's features.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation.
3. **Purchase**: Purchase a full license for commercial use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Signature, instantiate the `Signature` class in your Java application:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

class InitializeGroupDocs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Signature signature = new Signature("path/to/your/document");
        // Additional setup and operations can be performed here.
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Custom XOR Encryption Feature

The custom XOR encryption feature allows you to encrypt data using the XOR operation, a simple yet effective method for basic security needs.

#### Step 1: Implement IDataEncryption Interface
Begin by implementing the `IDataEncryption` interface to define your encryption logic:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions.encryption.IDataEncryption;

class CustomXOREncryption implements IDataEncryption {
    private int auto_Key;
    
    public final int getKey() {
        return auto_Key;
    }
    
    // Additional methods for encryption and decryption will be implemented here.
}
```

#### Step 2: Define Encryption and Decryption Methods
Implement the logic to encrypt and decrypt data using XOR:
```java
class CustomXOREncryption {
    private int auto_Key;

    public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data) {
        if (auto_Key == 0 || data == null) return data;
        
        byte[] result = new byte[data.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            result[i] = (byte) (data[i] ^ auto_Key);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public byte[] decrypt(byte[] encryptedData) {
        // Since XOR is symmetric, use the same method as encryption
        return encrypt(encryptedData);
    }
}
```
### Key Configuration Options

- **auto_Key**: This integer key must be non-empty and used for both encryption and decryption. Customize it to suit your security requirements.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure `auto_Key` is set before using the encryption methods.
- Validate input data to prevent null or empty byte arrays, which could lead to errors.

## Practical Applications

1. **Secure Document Signing**: Encrypt sensitive document content during digital signing processes.
2. **Data Integrity Verification**: Use custom XOR encryption for verifying data integrity within your application.
3. **Integration with Other Systems**: Seamlessly integrate encrypted data exchanges with external systems or databases.

These applications demonstrate how Custom XOR Encryption can enhance security in various scenarios.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- Utilize efficient byte manipulation techniques to handle large datasets.
- Profile your application to identify and address performance bottlenecks related to encryption operations.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Monitor memory usage, especially when processing large documents, to ensure optimal performance.

### Best Practices for Java Memory Management
- Use local variables within methods to limit the scope and lifetime of objects.
- Regularly release resources and nullify references to prevent memory leaks in your application.
