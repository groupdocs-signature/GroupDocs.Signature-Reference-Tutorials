### License Acquisition Steps
To use GroupDocs.Signature, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Test features with a temporary license.
- **Purchase**: Obtain a full license for production use.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once integrated, initialize your `Signature` object as follows:

```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

## Implementation Guide

This section covers the steps to delete a signature using its known ID with GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

### Overview of the Feature

Deleting signatures is essential for maintaining document integrity and compliance. This feature allows you to remove specific signatures based on their unique identifiers.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Define File Paths**
Create consistent file paths for your source and output documents:

```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_SIGNED_MULTI";
String fileName = new File(filePath).getName();
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/DeleteById/" + fileName;
```

**2. Initialize Signature Object**
Initialize the `Signature` object using the file path:

```java
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**3. Define and Delete Signature by ID**
Identify the signature to be deleted with its known ID and attempt deletion:

```java
String id = "eff64a14-dad9-47b0-88e5-2ee4e3604e71";
boolean result = signature.delete(id);
```

#### Explanation
- **Parameters**: The `delete` method requires the unique signature ID.
- **Return Values**: Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure the provided ID is accurate and exists within the document.
- Verify file paths are correctly set to avoid I/O errors.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Contract Management**: Remove outdated signatures from legal documents.
2. **Compliance Audits**: Streamline signature cleanup during audits.
3. **Document Versioning**: Maintain clean document versions by removing unnecessary signatures.

Integration possibilities include syncing with CRM systems or document management solutions for seamless operations.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents, consider the following:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Ensure your application handles large files efficiently.
- **Best Practices**: Utilize Javaâ€™s memory management techniques like garbage collection tuning.

These practices will help maintain optimal performance and resource usage.

## Conclusion
