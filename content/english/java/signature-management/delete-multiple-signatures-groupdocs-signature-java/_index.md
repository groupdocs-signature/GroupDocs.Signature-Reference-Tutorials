    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended access.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for long-term use.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
```java
// Initialize Signature instance
signature = new Signature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH");
```

With your environment set up, let's implement the feature!

## Implementation Guide

### Delete Multiple Signatures in PDFs

Deleting multiple signatures from a document can be complex. Hereâ€™s how you can simplify it using GroupDocs.Signature for Java.

#### Overview
This section demonstrates searching and deleting various types of signatures (like barcode and QR code) from a document.

#### Step 1: Define Paths
First, define paths for your input and output documents.
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YourDocument.pdf";
String fileName = Paths.get(filePath).getFileName().toString();
String outputFilePath = new File("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "DeleteMultipleAdvanced/").resolve(fileName).toString();

// Ensure the output directory exists
File dir = new File(outputFilePath.substring(0, outputFilePath.lastIndexOf('/')));
dir.mkdirs();
```
*Why this step?*: Ensuring your output path exists prevents file I/O exceptions.

#### Step 2: Initialize Signature Instance
Create an instance of the `Signature` class to work with your document.
```java
signature = new Signature(outputFilePath);
```

#### Step 3: Define Search Options
Set up search options for different types of signatures you want to delete.
```java
BarcodeSearchOptions barcodeOptions = new BarcodeSearchOptions();
QrCodeSearchOptions qrCodeOptions = new QrCodeSearchOptions();

List<SearchOptions> listOptions = Arrays.asList(barcodeOptions, qrCodeOptions);
```

#### Step 4: Search and Collect Signatures
Use the search options to find signatures in your document.
```java
SearchResult result = signature.search(listOptions);
if (result.getSignatures().size() > 0) {
    List<BaseSignature> signaturesToDelete = new ArrayList<>(result.getSignatures());
} else {
    System.out.println("No signatures were found.");
}
```
*Why search?*: Identifying which signatures to delete is crucial before removal.

#### Step 5: Delete Signatures
Finally, proceed with deleting the collected signatures.
```java
if (!signaturesToDelete.isEmpty()) {
    DeleteResult deleteResult = signature.delete(outputFilePath, signaturesToDelete);
    if (deleteResult.getSucceeded().size() == signaturesToDelete.size()) {
        System.out.println("All signatures were successfully deleted!");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Successfully deleted signatures: " + deleteResult.getSucceeded().size());
        System.out.println("Not deleted signatures: " + deleteResult.getFailed().size());
    }
}
```
*Why this step?*: It confirms the success of your deletion operation.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure you have write permissions for the output directory.
- Check that your document path is correct and accessible.

## Practical Applications

**Use Case 1**: Legal Document Management - Quickly remove outdated signatures from legal contracts before renewal.

**Use Case 2**: Contract Renewals - Automate signature cleanup in multi-party agreements.

**Use Case 3**: Invoice Processing - Delete previous approvals from invoices for a cleaner revision history.

Integration with document management systems can further streamline operations, making this feature invaluable across various industries.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance:
- Process documents sequentially if they are large.
- Monitor memory usage and optimize garbage collection settings in Java.
- Use efficient file handling practices to minimize I/O overhead.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to effectively manage and delete multiple signatures from PDFs using GroupDocs.Signature for Java. This skill not only enhances document hygiene but also optimizes your workflow efficiency.
