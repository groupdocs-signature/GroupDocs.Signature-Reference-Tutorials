# Remove Digital Signatures from PDF Java

## Introduction

Ever found yourself staring at a PDF document, needing to remove old signatures before getting new approvals? Maybe you're automating a document workflow, or perhaps you need to clear outdated authorizations from contracts. Whatever the reason, manually removing digital signatures is tedious (and sometimes impossible without the right tools).

Here's the good news: **GroupDocs.Signature for Java** makes signature removal straightforward and programmatic. Whether you're dealing with one signature or dozens, this library handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on building your application.

In this guide, you'll learn exactly how to remove digital signatures from PDF using Java—from basic setup to handling multiple signatures at once. We'll cover real-world scenarios, common gotchas, and best practices that'll save you hours of debugging.

**What You'll Master:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Signature in your Java project
- Identifying and targeting specific signatures for removal
- Batch-deleting multiple signatures efficiently
- Troubleshooting common issues (because they happen!)
- Security considerations when managing digital signatures

Ready? Let's dive in.

## Why Remove PDF Signatures Programmatically?

Before we jump into code, let's talk about *why* you'd want to automate this process. Understanding the use cases helps you build better solutions.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

1. **Document Revision Workflows**: Your contract went through three approval rounds. Now you need to clear all signatures and start fresh with updated terms—doing this manually for 50 documents? No thanks.

2. **Signature Replacement**: The signatory left the company. You need to remove their signature and route the document for re-approval. Happens more often than you'd think.

3. **Testing and Development**: You're building a document management system and need clean test documents. Programmatically removing signatures lets you reset documents quickly.

4. **Compliance Requirements**: Some industries require removing interim signatures while maintaining the final approval chain. Automation ensures consistency.

5. **Batch Processing**: Processing hundreds of documents from a legacy system? You can't manually open each PDF—you need code that scales.

**The Manual Alternative** (spoiler: it's painful):
- Open each PDF in Adobe Acrobat or similar software
- Navigate to signature fields
- Right-click and clear each signature
- Save and repeat... and repeat... and repeat

With GroupDocs.Signature, you'll write the code once and apply it to any number of documents. That's the power of programmatic signature management.

## Understanding PDF Signature Types

Not all PDF signatures are created equal. Before you start removing them, it's helpful to know what you're dealing with.

**Digital Signatures vs. Image Signatures:**

- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographically secure, linked to certificates. These prove document authenticity and detect tampering. Think: legal contracts, financial documents.

- **Image-Based Signatures**: Visual representations (like scanned signatures) without cryptographic backing. They look official but don't provide security.

GroupDocs.Signature handles both types, but understanding the difference matters for your application logic. Digital signatures often have stricter removal requirements (you might need to verify permissions first).

**What Happens When You Delete a Signature?**
- The signature field is removed from the document
- Any associated metadata (timestamp, signer info) is cleared
- The document reverts to an unsigned state *for that signature*
- Other signatures in the document remain intact (unless you delete them too)

## Prerequisites

Let's make sure you've got everything you need before we start coding. No surprises mid-tutorial!

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

- **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**: Version 23.12 or later (newer versions work too, but we'll use this as our baseline)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher. If you're on Java 11 or 17, even better.

### Environment Setup Requirements

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or even VS Code with Java extensions
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle (we'll show both configurations)
- **Test PDF**: A signed PDF document to work with. If you don't have one handy, you can create a test document using GroupDocs.Signature itself (or use Adobe Acrobat to sign a sample PDF).

### Knowledge Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:
- Basic Java syntax (classes, methods, imports)
- File handling in Java (reading/writing files)
- Using third-party libraries in your projects

Don't worry if you're not a Java expert—we'll explain each step clearly. If you can follow along with code examples, you're good to go.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

Time to add GroupDocs.Signature to your project. Choose your weapon (Maven or Gradle) and follow along.

### Maven Setup

Add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

Save the file, and Maven will download the library automatically (you might need to run `mvn clean install` to trigger it).

### Gradle Setup

For Gradle users, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

Run `gradle build` to pull in the dependency.

### Direct Download (If You're Old School)

Not using Maven or Gradle? No judgment—download the JAR directly from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/) and add it to your project's classpath.

### License Acquisition Steps

GroupDocs.Signature offers several licensing options:

1. **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to test features. Perfect for POCs and initial development. [Get your free trial here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

2. **Temporary License**: Need more time? Grab a temporary license for extended evaluation (30 days typically). [Request temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

3. **Full License**: Ready for production? [Purchase a license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) that matches your needs (developer, site, or OEM licenses available).

**Pro Tip**: The free trial includes all features but adds watermarks to output. Perfect for development, but you'll need a license before going live.

## Basic Initialization and Setup

Let's write our first lines of code. We'll initialize a `Signature` instance that points to your signed PDF.

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_signed_multi.pdf";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**What's happening here?**
- We're importing the `Signature` class from GroupDocs
- `filePath` points to your signed PDF (replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with your actual path, like `C:/Documents/` or `/home/user/pdfs/`)
- The `Signature` object is your gateway to all signature operations—reading, adding, and (drumroll) deleting signatures

**Important Notes:**
- Make sure the file path is correct and the file exists (FileNotFoundException will greet you otherwise)
- The PDF should have at least one signature; otherwise, there's nothing to delete (but the code won't crash—it'll just report zero deletions)

## Implementation Guide

Now we get to the good stuff—actually removing those signatures. We'll break this down into clear, digestible steps.

### Step 1: Initialize Signature Instance

First things first: point your `Signature` object to the document you're working with.

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_signed_multi.pdf";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `filePath`: The full path to your signed PDF. Can be absolute (`C:/docs/contract.pdf`) or relative (`./docs/contract.pdf`)

**Why This Matters:**
This initialization step loads the document into memory and prepares it for signature operations. GroupDocs reads the PDF structure and identifies all existing signatures—you'll need this info for the next step.

### Step 2: Prepare List of Signature Identifiers

Here's where it gets interesting. Every signature in a PDF has a unique identifier (think of it as a signature's fingerprint). To delete specific signatures, you need to know their IDs.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List<String> signatureIdList = new ArrayList<>();
signatureIdList.add("ff988ab1-7403-4c8d-8db7-f2a56b9f8530");
signatureIdList.add("07f83369-318b-41ad-a843-732417b912c2");
signatureIdList.add("e3ad0ec7-9abf-426d-b9aa-b3328f3f1470");
signatureIdList.add("eff64a14-dad9-47b0-88e5-2ee4e3604e71");
```

**Wait—How Do I Find These IDs?**

Great question! You typically get signature IDs in one of three ways:

1. **Search First**: Use GroupDocs to search the document for signatures, which returns their IDs:
   ```java
   // Quick example (we'll cover this more later)
   List<BaseSignature> signatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
   for (BaseSignature sig : signatures) {
       System.out.println("Found signature ID: " + sig.getSignatureId());
   }
   ```

2. **Store During Creation**: When you add signatures programmatically, save the IDs for later reference.

3. **Database/Storage**: In real applications, you'd typically store signature IDs in a database alongside document metadata.

**Pro Tip**: In practice, you'll rarely hard-code signature IDs like this. The example uses hard-coded values to keep things simple, but your real application should fetch IDs dynamically.

### Step 3: Delete Signatures by IDs

This is the moment we've been building toward—actually removing those signatures.

```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.DeleteResult;

DeleteResult deleteResult = signature.delete(signatureIdList);

if (deleteResult.getSucceeded().size() == signatureIdList.size()) {
    System.out.println("All signatures were successfully deleted.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Some signatures could not be deleted. Check their identifiers or document access permissions.");
}
```

**Breaking Down the Code:**

- `signature.delete(signatureIdList)`: The magic method that removes all signatures matching the provided IDs
- `deleteResult`: Contains details about which signatures were deleted and which failed (if any)
- `getSucceeded().size()`: Returns the count of successfully deleted signatures

**Return Values You Should Know:**
- `deleteResult.getSucceeded()`: List of signatures that were successfully removed
- `deleteResult.getFailed()`: List of signatures that couldn't be deleted (with reasons why)

**What Could Go Wrong?**
Several things might prevent signature deletion:
- Invalid signature ID (typo or non-existent signature)
- File permissions (read-only PDF)
- Signature protection (some signatures can be locked)
- Corrupted PDF structure

We'll dig deeper into troubleshooting in the next section.

### Step 4: Save Changes (Don't Forget!)

After deleting signatures, you need to save the modified document. GroupDocs doesn't automatically overwrite your original file (which is good—safety first!).

```java
// Save to a new file (recommended)
String outputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_signed_multi_clean.pdf";
signature.save(outputPath);

// Or overwrite the original (use with caution!)
signature.save(filePath);
```

**Best Practice**: Always save to a new file during development. Only overwrite originals in production when you're confident in your error handling.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Let's talk about the gotchas that trip up even experienced developers. Learn from others' mistakes (mine included!).

### Pitfall 1: Assuming Signature IDs Are Stable

**The Problem**: Signature IDs can change if you modify and re-save the document multiple times.

**The Fix**: Always fetch fresh signature IDs before deletion. Don't rely on IDs stored weeks ago.

```java
// Good: Fetch IDs right before deleting
List<BaseSignature> currentSignatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
List<String> idsToDelete = currentSignatures.stream()
    .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
signature.delete(idsToDelete);
```

### Pitfall 2: Not Handling Partial Failures

**The Problem**: Deleting 10 signatures, but 2 fail—your code treats it as complete success.

**The Fix**: Always check the `DeleteResult` and handle failures gracefully.

```java
DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIdList);

if (!result.getFailed().isEmpty()) {
    System.err.println("Failed to delete " + result.getFailed().size() + " signatures:");
    for (BaseSignature failed : result.getFailed()) {
        System.err.println("  - ID: " + failed.getSignatureId());
    }
    // Log the error, notify admin, or retry
}
```

### Pitfall 3: File Locking Issues

**The Problem**: The PDF is open in another application (like Adobe Reader), causing save failures.

**The Fix**: Close file handles properly and implement retry logic:

```java
try (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath)) {
    // Your deletion code here
    signature.delete(signatureIdList);
    signature.save(outputPath);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("File access error: " + e.getMessage());
    // Implement retry or notify user to close the file
}
```

### Pitfall 4: Memory Leaks with Large Batches

**The Problem**: Processing hundreds of PDFs without properly disposing of `Signature` instances.

**The Fix**: Use try-with-resources (shown above) or explicitly call `dispose()`:

```java
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
try {
    // Your code here
} finally {
    signature.dispose(); // Releases resources
}
```

## Best Practices for Signature Management

Here are battle-tested practices that'll make your life easier (and your code more reliable).

### 1. Always Validate Before Deleting

Don't blindly delete signatures—verify they exist first:

```java
List<BaseSignature> existingSignatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
List<String> validIds = signatureIdList.stream()
    .filter(id -> existingSignatures.stream()
        .anyMatch(sig -> sig.getSignatureId().equals(id)))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

if (validIds.size() < signatureIdList.size()) {
    System.out.println("Warning: Some signature IDs not found in document.");
}
```

### 2. Implement Audit Logging

Track who deleted what and when:

```java
DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIdList);
for (BaseSignature deleted : result.getSucceeded()) {
    auditLog.log("User: " + currentUser + 
                 " deleted signature ID: " + deleted.getSignatureId() +
                 " from document: " + filePath +
                 " at: " + Instant.now());
}
```

### 3. Backup Before Bulk Operations

When processing multiple documents, back up originals:

```java
// Create backup before deletion
Path backup = Paths.get(filePath + ".backup");
Files.copy(Paths.get(filePath), backup, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);

try {
    // Perform deletion
    signature.delete(signatureIdList);
    signature.save(filePath);
    Files.delete(backup); // Delete backup on success
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Restore from backup on failure
    Files.copy(backup, Paths.get(filePath), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    throw e;
}
```

### 4. Use Descriptive Variable Names in Production

Our tutorial uses simple names, but production code should be clear:

```java
// Instead of this
List<String> ids = new ArrayList<>();

// Do this
List<String> outdatedSignatureIds = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> signaturesToRemoveBeforeReApproval = new ArrayList<>();
```

### 5. Implement Proper Error Handling

Don't just catch and print—handle errors meaningfully:

```java
try {
    DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIdList);
    
    if (result.getFailed().isEmpty()) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("All signatures removed successfully");
    } else {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.PARTIAL_CONTENT)
            .body("Removed " + result.getSucceeded().size() + "/" + 
                  signatureIdList.size() + " signatures");
    }
} catch (SignatureException e) {
    logger.error("Signature deletion failed", e);
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
        .body("Failed to remove signatures: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Practical Applications

Let's look at real-world scenarios where this code solves actual problems.

### Use Case 1: Contract Revision Workflow

**Scenario**: Your legal team revises contracts quarterly. Old signatures must be removed before routing for new approvals.

**Implementation Approach**:
```java
public void prepareContractForRevision(String contractPath) {
    try (Signature signature = new Signature(contractPath)) {
        // Find all existing signatures
        List<BaseSignature> allSignatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
        
        // Extract IDs
        List<String> allIds = allSignatures.stream()
            .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        
        // Delete all signatures
        DeleteResult result = signature.delete(allIds);
        
        // Save cleaned document
        String revisedPath = contractPath.replace(".pdf", "_revision.pdf");
        signature.save(revisedPath);
        
        // Log the action
        System.out.println("Removed " + result.getSucceeded().size() + 
                           " signatures from " + contractPath);
    }
}
```

### Use Case 2: Bulk Document Processing

**Scenario**: Migrating 500 legacy documents from an old system. Need to clear all signatures and prepare for re-approval.

**Implementation Approach**:
```java
public void processBulkDocuments(List<String> documentPaths) {
    int successCount = 0;
    int failureCount = 0;
    
    for (String docPath : documentPaths) {
        try (Signature signature = new Signature(docPath)) {
            List<BaseSignature> signatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
            
            if (!signatures.isEmpty()) {
                List<String> ids = signatures.stream()
                    .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
                
                signature.delete(ids);
                signature.save(docPath);
                successCount++;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to process: " + docPath);
            failureCount++;
        }
    }
    
    System.out.println("Processed " + successCount + " documents successfully, " +
                       failureCount + " failures");
}
```

### Use Case 3: Testing Document Workflows

**Scenario**: Your test suite needs clean PDFs for each test run.

**Implementation Approach**:
```java
@Before
public void resetTestDocuments() {
    String testDoc = "test-resources/sample.pdf";
    try (Signature signature = new Signature(testDoc)) {
        List<BaseSignature> signatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
        
        if (!signatures.isEmpty()) {
            List<String> ids = signatures.stream()
                .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
            signature.delete(ids);
            signature.save(testDoc);
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

When things go wrong (and they will), here's your debugging guide.

### Issue: "Signature ID not found"

**Symptoms**: DeleteResult shows all signatures in the Failed list.

**Diagnosis**:
```java
// Check if IDs actually exist
List<BaseSignature> allSigs = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
System.out.println("Available signature IDs:");
allSigs.forEach(sig -> System.out.println("  - " + sig.getSignatureId()));
```

**Solution**: Verify you're using current IDs, not outdated ones from a previous document version.

### Issue: "Access denied" or permission errors

**Symptoms**: Exception thrown during delete or save operation.

**Diagnosis**:
```java
File pdfFile = new File(filePath);
System.out.println("Can read: " + pdfFile.canRead());
System.out.println("Can write: " + pdfFile.canWrite());
```

**Solutions**:
- Check file permissions in your OS
- Ensure no other application has the file open
- Verify your application has write access to the directory
- Try running your application with appropriate permissions

### Issue: Signatures deleted but document won't save

**Symptoms**: Delete operation succeeds, but save() throws an exception.

**Common Causes**:
- Insufficient disk space
- Invalid output path
- File system restrictions

**Solution**:
```java
try {
    String outputPath = "output/cleaned_document.pdf";
    
    // Ensure directory exists
    Path outputDir = Paths.get(outputPath).getParent();
    if (!Files.exists(outputDir)) {
        Files.createDirectories(outputDir);
    }
    
    signature.save(outputPath);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Save failed: " + e.getMessage());
    // Check disk space, permissions, etc.
}
```

### Issue: Some signatures can't be deleted

**Symptoms**: DeleteResult shows partial success—some signatures deleted, others failed.

**Possible Reasons**:
1. Signature is locked/protected (check signature properties)
2. Signature is corrupted in the PDF structure
3. Signature has special permissions requiring additional authentication

**Debugging Strategy**:
```java
DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIdList);

for (BaseSignature failed : result.getFailed()) {
    System.err.println("Failed to delete signature:");
    System.err.println("  ID: " + failed.getSignatureId());
    System.err.println("  Type: " + failed.getSignatureType());
    // Examine properties to understand why it failed
}
```

## Security Considerations

Removing signatures has security implications. Here's what you need to think about.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

**Question to Ask**: Who should be allowed to remove signatures?

**Implementation Tip**:
```java
public DeleteResult removeSignatures(String documentId, List<String> signatureIds, User currentUser) {
    // Check permissions first
    if (!hasPermissionToModify(currentUser, documentId)) {
        throw new UnauthorizedException("User lacks permission to modify signatures");
    }
    
    // Proceed with deletion only if authorized
    try (Signature signature = new Signature(getDocumentPath(documentId))) {
        return signature.delete(signatureIds);
    }
}
```

### 2. Audit Trail Maintenance

**Why It Matters**: Regulatory compliance often requires knowing who deleted what and when.

**Best Practice**: Log every deletion with full context:
```java
auditService.logSignatureDeletion(
    userId: currentUser.getId(),
    documentId: documentId,
    signatureIds: signatureIds,
    timestamp: Instant.now(),
    ipAddress: request.getRemoteAddr(),
    reason: deletionReason
);
```

### 3. Document Integrity Verification

**Consider**: After removing signatures, does the document still meet integrity requirements?

**Implementation**:
```java
// Before deletion
String originalHash = calculateDocumentHash(filePath);

// After deletion and save
String newHash = calculateDocumentHash(outputPath);

// Verify the document structure is still valid
if (!isValidPDF(outputPath)) {
    // Restore from backup
    restoreOriginal(filePath);
    throw new DocumentCorruptionException("Document integrity compromised");
}
```

### 4. Backup and Recovery

**Always**: Maintain backups before bulk signature removal operations.

**Example Strategy**:
```java
public class SafeSignatureRemoval {
    public void removeWithBackup(String documentPath, List<String> signatureIds) {
        String backupPath = createBackup(documentPath);
        
        try (Signature signature = new Signature(documentPath)) {
            DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIds);
            signature.save(documentPath);
            
            // Verify success before deleting backup
            if (result.getFailed().isEmpty()) {
                deleteBackup(backupPath);
            } else {
                // Keep backup if there were failures
                System.out.println("Backup retained at: " + backupPath);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            restoreFromBackup(backupPath, documentPath);
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Let's talk about keeping your application fast and resource-efficient.

### Optimize Resource Usage

**Memory Management**:
```java
// Good: Process documents in batches
public void processBatch(List<String> documents, int batchSize) {
    for (int i = 0; i < documents.size(); i += batchSize) {
        List<String> batch = documents.subList(i, 
            Math.min(i + batchSize, documents.size()));
        
        for (String doc : batch) {
            try (Signature signature = new Signature(doc)) {
                // Process each document
                processSignatures(signature);
            } // Auto-closes and releases memory
        }
        
        // Optional: Force garbage collection between batches
        System.gc();
    }
}
```

### Parallel Processing for Bulk Operations

**When You Have Many Documents**:
```java
public void processDocumentsInParallel(List<String> documentPaths) {
    documentPaths.parallelStream()
        .forEach(docPath -> {
            try (Signature signature = new Signature(docPath)) {
                List<BaseSignature> signatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
                
                if (!signatures.isEmpty()) {
                    List<String> ids = signatures.stream()
                        .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
                    
                    signature.delete(ids);
                    signature.save(docPath);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.err.println("Failed: " + docPath);
            }
        });
}
```

**Caution**: Parallel processing increases CPU and memory usage. Monitor your resources and adjust thread counts accordingly.

### JVM Tuning Tips

For high-volume signature processing:

```bash

## FAQ Section

### 1. How do I obtain a temporary license for GroupDocs.Signature?

Visit the [Temporary License page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) and fill out the request form. You'll typically receive your license within 24 hours. The temporary license gives you full feature access for 30 days—perfect for development and testing.

### 2. Can I delete signatures from other file formats using GroupDocs.Signature?

Absolutely! GroupDocs.Signature supports 40+ document formats including:
- Microsoft Word (DOC, DOCX)
- Excel spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX)
- PowerPoint presentations (PPT, PPTX)
- Image files (PNG, JPG, TIFF)

The code structure remains nearly identical—just change the file path. The library automatically detects the format and handles signature removal accordingly.

### 3. What if a signature cannot be deleted due to permission issues?

This usually happens for one of three reasons:

**File-level permissions**: Your application doesn't have write access to the PDF. Solution: Check file permissions in your operating system and ensure your Java application runs with appropriate privileges.

**Document-level protection**: The PDF itself has security settings preventing modifications. Solution: You'll need to remove document restrictions first (if you have permission) or work with an unprotected copy.

**Signature-level protection**: The signature is locked by the signing authority. Solution: These signatures typically can't be removed programmatically—contact the original signer or document owner.

**Debugging tip**:
```java
try {
    signature.delete(signatureIds);
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("Error details: " + e.getMessage());
    System.err.println("Cause: " + e.getCause());
    // This will help you identify the specific permission issue
}
```

### 4. How can I verify which signatures were successfully removed?

The `DeleteResult` object gives you complete visibility:

```java
DeleteResult result = signature.delete(signatureIdList);

// Check successful deletions
System.out.println("Successfully deleted:");
for (BaseSignature success : result.getSucceeded()) {
    System.out.println("  - Signature ID: " + success.getSignatureId());
}

// Check failed deletions
System.out.println("\nFailed to delete:");
for (BaseSignature failure : result.getFailed()) {
    System.out.println("  - Signature ID: " + failure.getSignatureId());
}

// Get counts
int successCount = result.getSucceeded().size();
int failureCount = result.getFailed().size();
System.out.println("\nSummary: " + successCount + " succeeded, " + failureCount + " failed");
```

You can also re-search the document after deletion to confirm:
```java
List<BaseSignature> remainingSignatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
System.out.println("Remaining signatures in document: " + remainingSignatures.size());
```

### 5. Is there support available for GroupDocs.Signature?

Yes! GroupDocs provides multiple support channels:

**Free Support Forum**: Post questions and get help from the community and GroupDocs staff at the [GroupDocs Support Forum](https://forum.groupdocs.com/c/signature/). Response times are typically 24-48 hours.

**Paid Support**: Purchase a support plan for priority assistance (response times as low as 4 hours for critical issues).

**Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available at [GroupDocs Documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

**Stack Overflow**: Tag your questions with `groupdocs` for community help.

**Pro tip**: When asking for support, always include:
- Your GroupDocs.Signature version
- Java version
- Sample code that reproduces the issue
- Error messages (full stack trace)
- Document format you're working with

### 6. Can I selectively delete signatures based on criteria other than ID?

Yes! You can filter signatures by multiple properties before deletion:

```java
// Search for all digital signatures
List<DigitalSignature> digitalSignatures = signature.search(DigitalSignature.class, SignatureType.Digital);

// Filter by signer name
List<String> idsToDelete = digitalSignatures.stream()
    .filter(sig -> sig.getComments().contains("John Doe"))
    .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Or filter by signature date
List<String> oldSignatureIds = digitalSignatures.stream()
    .filter(sig -> sig.getSignTime().before(cutoffDate))
    .map(BaseSignature::getSignatureId)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

signature.delete(idsToDelete);
```

This is particularly useful when you need to remove outdated signatures or signatures from specific individuals.

### 7. Does deleting a signature invalidate other signatures in the document?

Generally, no—each signature is independent. However, there are exceptions:

**Timestamp Signatures**: If you delete a timestamp signature that was used to validate other signatures, those signatures may lose their time-based validation.

**Certificate Chains**: In documents with signature chains (where one signature validates another), removing a signature in the chain can break the validation flow.

**Best Practice**: If your document has complex signature relationships, analyze the signature structure before deletion:

```java
// Check signature dependencies before deleting
List<BaseSignature> allSignatures = signature.search(SignatureType.Digital);
for (BaseSignature sig : allSignatures) {
    if (sig instanceof DigitalSignature) {
        DigitalSignature digitalSig = (DigitalSignature) sig;
        // Examine certificate chain, timestamps, etc.
        System.out.println("Signature: " + digitalSig.getSignatureId());
        System.out.println("Signed by: " + digitalSig.getComments());
    }
}
```

### 8. What's the performance impact of deleting many signatures at once?

Deleting multiple signatures in a single operation is more efficient than deleting them one by one:

**Single Operation (Recommended)**:
```java
// Deletes all in one go - faster!
signature.delete(Arrays.asList(id1, id2, id3, id4, id5));
```

**Multiple Operations (Slower)**:
```java
// Don't do this - much slower!
signature.delete(Arrays.asList(id1));
signature.delete(Arrays.asList(id2));
signature.delete(Arrays.asList(id3));
// etc.
```

**Performance Benchmarks** (approximate, varies by document size):
- 1-10 signatures: < 1 second
- 10-50 signatures: 1-3 seconds
- 50+ signatures: 3-10 seconds

For documents with hundreds of signatures, consider processing in batches of 50-100 signatures per operation.
