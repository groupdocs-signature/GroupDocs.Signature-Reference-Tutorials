Ready to enhance your document management skills? Let's start with the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have these requirements covered:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Signature for Java**: Use version 23.12 or later.
  

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A working Java development environment (JDK 8 or higher).
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to set up GroupDocs.Signature for your project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Signature for Java

To integrate GroupDocs.Signature into your Java application, follow these steps:

### Installation Information

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-signature</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-signature:23.12'
```

**Direct Download**
Download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Signature for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/signature/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs.Signature features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you want full access during development.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how you can initialize the `Signature` object:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;

String filePath = "path/to/your/document.pdf";
Signature signature = new Signature(filePath);
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that we have set up GroupDocs.Signature, let's focus on deleting a text signature by its ID.

### Overview of Deleting Text Signatures
Deleting text signatures involves identifying them using their unique `SignatureId` and then removing them from the document. This feature is essential for updating or revoking electronic signatures as needed.

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes
First, ensure you have imported all necessary classes:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.Signature;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.DeleteResult;
import com.groupdocs.signature.domain.signatures.BaseSignature;
import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

#### Step 2: Set Up File Paths
Define the input and output file paths. Replace placeholders with your actual document paths.
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
File inputFile = new File(filePath);
String fileName = inputFile.getName();
String outputFilePath = new File("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
