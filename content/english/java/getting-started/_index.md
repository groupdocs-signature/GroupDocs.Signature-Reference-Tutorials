## Common Setup Challenges & Solutions

Even with great documentation, you might hit a few speed bumps during initial setup. Here are the most common issues beginners encounter and how to solve them quickly:

**Issue: "License file not found" exception**  
This usually happens when the license file path is incorrect or the file isn't included in your build output. Make sure the license file is in your resources folder (src/main/resources for Maven/Gradle projects) and use a classpath-relative path like `/MyLicense.lic`. If you're using an IDE, verify the file is being copied to your target/build directory.

**Issue: "Evaluation watermarks appearing on documents"**  
You're running in evaluation mode, which means either the license isn't loading or hasn't been applied before creating Signature instances. Call the license setup method at application startup (in your main method or Spring configuration) before any signature operations. Double-check that your license file is valid and hasn't expired.

**Issue: "Unsupported document format" errors**  
GroupDocs.Signature supports 40+ formats, but some specialty formats might require specific format options. Check the document extension matches its actual format (sometimes files are misnamed). For unusual formats, consult the format compatibility documentation or use the library's format detection methods to identify the actual document type.

**Issue: Maven/Gradle dependency resolution failures**  
Make sure you've added the GroupDocs repository to your build configuration. The library isn't in Maven Central, so you need to explicitly add the GroupDocs Maven repository URL. Check your internet connection and corporate proxy settings—some firewalls block repository access. If problems persist, try clearing your local Maven cache (.m2 folder) or Gradle cache.

**Issue: OutOfMemoryError with large documents**  
Processing large documents (especially PDFs with many pages or high-resolution images) can consume significant memory. Increase your JVM heap size using `-Xmx` flags (e.g., `-Xmx2g` for 2GB). Consider processing large documents in batches or streaming mode if available. Also, always dispose of Signature instances properly using try-with-resources to prevent memory leaks.
