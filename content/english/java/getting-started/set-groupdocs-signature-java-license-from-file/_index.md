## Implementation Guide: Setting License from File

Setting a license is essential to unlock all functionalities of GroupDocs.Signature. Follow these steps:

### Overview
Defining a clear license path allows you to use the library's full suite of features efficiently.

#### Step 1: Define License Path
Specify where your license file resides:
```java
String LICENSE_PATH = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath"; // Replace with actual license file path
```

#### Step 2: Implement License Setting Logic
Incorporate this logic within a class method to apply the license:
```java
import com.groupdocs.signature.licensing.License;
import java.io.File;

public class SetLicenseFromFile {
    public static void run() {
        File file = new File(LICENSE_PATH);
        if (file.exists()) {
            License license = new License();
            // Apply the license from the specified path
            license.setLicense(LICENSE_PATH);
            System.out.println("License set successfully.");
        } else {
            System.err.println("License file not found. Please check the path.");
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**
- **License Path:** Ensure it points to your actual license file.
